Temasek Secondary School is a place of teaching and learning, but more so a place for boys and girls to become young men and women - it is a place where learning comes alive with the wide range of opportunities offered in and out of the classroom. Temasekians shine by discovering what they really like to do and are developed to excel at it. They also feel empowered to exercise their creativity, voice and leadership in an inclusive environment that is challenging, nurturing, and caring.  
  
This is the Temasek School Experience - a journey where students explore, grow with each opportunity, a passage where dreams become reality.

One of the defining moments for every Temasekian is the Sec 1 Orientation. During this programme, Secondary 1 students are introduced to what it means to be a Temasekian.
