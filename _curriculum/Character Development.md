The Student Development Team (SDT) oversees the design and delivery of a holistic student development experience. With a focus on character education and life-skills development, every Temasekian is nurtured to be a socially responsible youth who is able to lead purposeful lives.&nbsp;

  

Each level is overseen by the Year Head Team and the Discipline Committee, that work closely with the Form Teachers to meet the social-emotional needs of our students, while the Character and Citizenship ([CCE](/co-curriculum/character-n-citizenship-education-cce/)), LEAD@TMS: Student Leadership, and Cross Cultural Awareness (C2A) teams deliver a coherent and customised experience that helps our students be grounded in a core set of values whilst developing new 21st century competencies that will prepare them for the future.
