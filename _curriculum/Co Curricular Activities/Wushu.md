HISTORY
-------

The Temasek Wushu Team was set up in 2002 and its membership has grown to the present strength of approximately 50 members. As the only martial arts CCA in Temasek, its members are in demand for their ability to showcase performances that exhibit speed, strength and flexibility. The members are also exposed to theatrical performance to develop their showmanship.   

MISSION

Wushu aspires to develop martial arts skills in its members through a blend of performance and finesse. Through this, we aim to develop them into confident, disciplined and competent practitioners of Wushu who can display flexibility and strength in their movement through flawless execution.   

TRAINING
