The members are also exposed to theatrical performance to develop their showmanship.&nbsp;</p><h2>MISSION</h2><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="ws.jpg" src="/images/ws.jpg"></div><p>Wushu aspires to develop martial arts skills in its members through a blend of performance and finesse.
