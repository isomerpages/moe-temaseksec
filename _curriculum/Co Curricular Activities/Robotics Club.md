## HISTORY


The Robotics Club first started in 2007 as the Mathematics Club. In 2015, the club was renamed as the Robotics Club in recognition of the shift towards enabling our students to be future ready. The club was revamped as a specialised CCA providing opportunities to train students in four specific disciplines – Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) – through an interdisciplinary and applied approach using Robotics programming and construction as a platform. Currently, the robotics club has approximately 30 members.
