## HISTORY


The Infocomm Media Club started with the merger of the 'Audio-Visual (AV) Club' and the 'Photography Club' to provide students with a more holistic experience. Students provide support for school events which allow them to pursue their interests in the areas of audio-visual technology, photography and more recently, videography. Currently, the club has approximately 60 members.

## MISSION


The Infocomm Media Club aims to develop in our students the skills of communicating effectively, making critical observations, and having a keen eye for detail. These are skills that are crucial for managing the technical support for an event and taking purposeful photographs and videos.

## TRAINING
