## MISSION


Basketball aspires to provide its players with the opportunity to learn the fundamental skills of basketball while instilling life-lessons and values such as character, team work, discipline, respect and sportsmanship.

## TRAINING

Training is held twice a week in school. The training programme is holistic in approach, focusing on two aspects.  
  
The first aspect is developing physical fitness such as timing, coordination, speed, strength, and stamina with an emphasis on ball handling skills of dribbling, passing and shooting. The second aspect seeks to maintain an athlete’s well-being with sessions on nutrition and injury management. Members also learn technical aspects in basketball refereeing to enhance their game knowledge.
