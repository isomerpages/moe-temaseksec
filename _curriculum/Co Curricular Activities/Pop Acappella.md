## HISTORY


The Temasek Acappella Group (TAG) was first established in 2001, as an interest group from the Temasek Chorale. Then known as St Elmo's Fire, the group's first major performance was at the Samsung Christmas Tree @ Orchard Road. In 2005, the group formally changed its name to Temasek Acappella Group and achieved accolades in competitions such as B'Dazzled, the Singapore A cappella Championships and T-Net Youth Got Talent. Currently, TAG has nearly 20 members.
