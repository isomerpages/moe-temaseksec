## HISTORY


The Netball team has had a long tradition in Temasek since the early days of the school’s establishment. Being the only all-female CCA with a current membership of over 40 members, it has evolved into a tenacious team that seeks to instil a lifelong passion for Netball.

## MISSION

Netball aspires to develop members into passionate sportswomen and inculcate values such as teamwork, discipline and perseverance.

## TRAINING


![netb2.jpg](/images/netb2.jpg)  
Training is held twice a week in school. The training programme comprises progressive phases that focus on physical conditioning, speed and agility training. Members learn tactical drills in defence and offence to be deployed in matches. Developing mastery in ball handling such as passing accuracy and shooting as well as footwork such as keeping control while pivoting are some aspects of training.
