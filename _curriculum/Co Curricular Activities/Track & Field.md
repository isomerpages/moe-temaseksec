## HISTORY


The Temasek Track &amp; Field team was established in 1984. Our 50 member strong Track &amp; Field team has a multi-disciplinary culture that is open to developing sporting talents from both within the Track &amp; Field team and also from other CCAs in Temasek.

## MISSION


Track &amp; Field aspires for every member to be an athlete who embraces challenges with determination and strives for performance excellence.

## TRAINING


![track2.jpg](/images/track2.jpg)  
  
Training is held twice a week in school and at various external venues such as Bedok Reservoir Park, MacRitchie Reservoir Park and Bedok Stadium to expose members to different running conditions.  
  
Members go through a progressive and systematic training plan. Starting from developing a strong core strength affecting posture, balance and coordination, members then get to specialise in sprints, middle and/or long distance jumps and/or throws.  
  
The team trains for both individual events like the 200m, 800m and 1500m and team events like the 4 x 100m relay race.
