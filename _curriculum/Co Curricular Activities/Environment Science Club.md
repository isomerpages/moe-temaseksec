## HISTORY


The Environmental Science Club was first established in 2016, formerly known as The Green Club. Our CCA brings together like-minded students who want to do their part for environmental conservation and at the same time learn more about environmental issues, including climate change, biodiversity and much more.

## MISSION


The Environmental Science Club aspires to tackle the challenges of climate change through creating awareness and personal responsibility within our school and community. The members all uphold a common goal to develop environmentally-friendly habits which translate into lifelong actions that seek to make our world a better place. Our CCA also aims to learn more about biodiversity and strives to become people truly living in harmony with nature.

## TRAINING


Training is held twice a week in school. Students engage in activities that build their awareness of environmental sustainability. Students also learn how to prepare and conduct sharings on the spreading of environmental messages. Last but not least, students will also have hands-on opportunities to learn how to grow vegetables in an urban setting.
