The team trains twice a week at Bedok Reservoir, but will have additional training sessions nearing competitions. 

Apart from water training, we also do focus on the team’s physical conditioning. The team trains for events both in a single-seater kayak (K1) and team events such as a double-seater kayak (K2) and a 4-seater kayak (K4). We focus our trainings on the 500m and 1000m events.
