## HISTORY

Over the years, the Temasek NCC unit continues to strive for excellence whilst developing extraordinary youth leaders.

Training is held twice a week, where cadets get the opportunity to learn skills such as marching drills, technical handling of the SAR 21 rifles and marksmanship. Our cadets also get to develop a fit body and resilient mind through activities such as rock climbing, dragon boating and kayaking. Every year, our cadets can attend leadership courses such as the Physical Training Instructor Course and the Senior Specialist Leaders Course.
