Life is full of possibilities. In Temasek, a student’s potential is only limited by their imagination. Our Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) programmes are full and varied, and students are well-known for the breadth and depth of their interests, which we support whole-heartedly and thoroughly.  
  
Temasekians are truly keen on their many interests—be it Uniformed Groups, Sports, Performing Arts, or Clubs. Whichever CCA they are in, nurturing a sense of commitment and dedication to their craft is the culture here, and we want to also spark the passion towards activities the students engage in.  
  
Every Temasekian – ‘A citizen of character who seeks performance excellence in all that he does and is open to new learning and possibilities.’  
  
At Temasek Secondary School, students’ CCA experiences form a cornerstone of their holistic education for the 21st century. Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) have been an integral part of our Singapore education landscape in recognition of the fact that good academic performance alone is an insufficient gauge of student quality. The rapid advancement of technological innovations, global competition, and a push towards a knowledge-based economy require that our students learn to have a repertoire of soft and hard skills to enable them to succeed in a future economy that is still in the making. Our students are expected to develop a high Emotional Quotient to succeed in diverse work environments. At the same time, they can exhibit soft skills like creativity, leadership abilities, teamwork, flexibility, communication skills, resilience and an enterprising spirit that will enable them to stay relevant for the future.  
  
Therefore, the emphasis should not only be placed on the pursuit of academic excellence but also in the pursuit of meaningful opportunities and possibilities afforded through CCAs. CCAs become a platform in which a myriad of activities provide many teachable moments for students at Temasek to develop and practise crucial 21st century skills to create and secure lifelong success both as individuals and team players.

All Temasekians are required to take up a CCA from one of the core CCAs offered in Temasek. In Secondary One, students will be allotted a CCA based on one of five choices that the students have selected and they are expected to remain in that CCA for the duration of their secondary school years unless they have medical reasons that preclude them from serving their commitments to the CCA.  
  
Students are reminded to make their choices wisely as they may not be allotted CCA of their first choice in cases where the CCA is oversubscribed and they may be allotted choices other than their 1st choice.  
  
+Shooting, Choir, Drama, Modern Dance are CCAs that offer DSA.  
\*Canoeing will cease to accept boys from 2023.  
\*\*Chinese Orchestra will cease to operate from 2023.
