## TRAINING

Both air pistol and air rifle shooting are offered. The team trains twice a week. Shooters learn how to operate the guns safely, and other aspects of safety. They learn about their personal traits and inclinations, to specialise in one of the weapons eventually. Specific training programmes are offered to help all them strive for performance excellence.
