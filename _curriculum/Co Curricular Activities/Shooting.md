Both air pistol and air rifle shooting are offered. The team trains twice a week.&nbsp;Shooters learn how to operate the guns safely, and other aspects of safety. They learn about their personal traits and inclinations, to specialise in one of the weapons eventually.&nbsp;Specific training programmes are offered to help all them strive for performance excellence.
