**WHY CROSS-CULTURAL AWARENESS (C2A)**<br>
In preparing students for life, the school recognises the need for students to be equipped with cross-cultural skills and global awareness so as to navigate an increasingly diverse and complex world.

**OUTCOMES OF C2A**<br>The C2A curriculum allows students to engage in an interdisciplinary study of topics related to culture, race, religion, ethnicity, gender, history and heritage and globalisation within Singapore and our region. 

In particular, the curriculum seeks to develop the following outcomes:

**STAGES OF LEARNING**<br>
The key underlying principle of C2A is knowledge construction, sharing and application within a social constructivist paradigm. 
Under this paradigm, students develop the necessary attitudes, skills and knowledge through 3 stages of learning.
