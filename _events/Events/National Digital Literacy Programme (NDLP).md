At MOE’s Committee of Supply Debate in March 2020, MOE launched the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) for our schools and Institutes of Higher Learning to help students strengthen their digital literacy.  
  
One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary school students, whereby every secondary school student will own a Personal Learning Device (PLD) by end-2021. The PLDs will also be used in tandem with the SLS, for students to have access to curriculum-aligned resources.  
  
PDLP allows teachers to harness technology for greater effectiveness in teaching and learning, enabled by teachers’ use of e-Pedagogy to provide active learning experiences for students. PLDs will also allow for self-directed learning and students will be able to collaborate with each other, anytime and anywhere. Lastly, PLDs provide an immersive environment for students to develop their digital literacies.  
  
While the school has in place measures to ensure a safe and seamless learning environment for students, parents play an important role in helping their children better manage the use of the PLDs at home.
