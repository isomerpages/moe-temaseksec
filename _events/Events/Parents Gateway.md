Dear Parents,  
  
Parents Gateway is a digital platform developed by Ministry of Education (MOE) and GovTech to bring greater convenience to you to perform simple administrative transactions and to stay updated on schools’ programmes and activities. This enables you to better support your children in their education journey through closer interactions and communications with schools. &nbsp;  
  
Temasek Secondary School will be embarking on its use of Parents Gateway on 4 March 2019 and we would encourage all of you to download the Parents Gateway app from the following links below:&nbsp;
