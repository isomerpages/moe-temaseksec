Dear Parents,  
  
Parents Gateway is a digital platform developed by Ministry of Education (MOE) and GovTech to bring greater convenience to you to perform simple administrative transactions and to stay updated on schools’ programmes and activities. This enables you to better support your children in their education journey through closer interactions and communications with schools.    
  
Temasek Secondary School will be embarking on its use of Parents Gateway on 4 March 2019 and we would encourage all of you to download the Parents Gateway app from the following links below:   
  
1) [iOS Users](https://goo.gl/gT5LDr)    
2) [Android Users](https://goo.gl/5XHbZU)     
  
For assistance to download the Parents Gateway Mobile Application, you may view the instructional video [here](https://goo.gl/2EGMHD).  
  
To safeguard our students’ data, only parents who are registered in the official student records in the MOE database will be able to use the mobile app. The information shown on Parents Gateway is taken from the student records in the MOE database. If there is any discrepancy in the data shown on Parents Gateway, please contact the school at temasek_ss@moe.edu.sg to update the data.  
  
Starting from **15 April 2019**, we will discontinue the practice of disseminating hardcopy letters and consent form and  you will only receive such documents through Parents Gateway.
