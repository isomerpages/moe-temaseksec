Temasek Secondary School is giving back to Singapore for National Day!
Every year, since 2006, the school has been raising funds for the President's Challenge, a fund that supports 80 over charities and organisations in Singapore!

We need YOUR help to raise funds for the beneficiaries of the President's Challenge!

This year, as part of the Temasek Charity Challenge (TCC), we are raising funds by going to the streets to get your support! With every $2 donation, our volunteers will be giving you a super hero pen because YOU are a SUERHERO to the many beneficiaries of the President Challenge (PC)!

You can check out the full list of  [PC beneficiaries here!](https://www.presidentschallenge.gov.sg/whowesupport/)

If you want to donate, please send via through the QR Code using your PayNow scanner!
