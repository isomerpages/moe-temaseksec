<p>Our students are our future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They will become the leaders of character and intellect that we will need
to make a difference in Singapore and beyond.</p>
<p>With this vision,&nbsp;LEAD@TMS strives to develop students beyond Temasek
Secondary School through the Young Leaders Programme, a series of events
and workshops that are age-appropriate for young participants who wish
to learn more about leadership.</p>
