Our students are our future.&nbsp;

  

They will become the leaders of character and intellect that we will need to make a difference in Singapore and beyond.

With this vision,&nbsp;LEAD@TMS strives to develop students beyond Temasek Secondary School through the Young Leaders Programme, a series of events and workshops that are age-appropriate for young participants who wish to learn more about leadership.
