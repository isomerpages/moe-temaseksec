This year, Singapore celebrates her 54th birthday back at the Padang and we are very proud to have our Secondary One Temasekians being part of the Finale Act.  
  
These students had dedicated many hours, including weekends in the last few months, to perfect their routines and formations such as the Changi Airport control tower and the Supertree of Gardens By the Bay.  
  
Many thanks to the teachers and parents who have supported our Temasekians in being part of this historical parade.
