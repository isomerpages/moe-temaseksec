On 13 July 2019, Nur Rabia'Tul Adawiyah received the Singapore Civil Defence Force-National Civil Defence Cadet Corps (SCDF-NCDCC) Pinnacle Badge at the NCDCC Affirmation Day Ceremony at Heartbeat@Bedok. This badge is the highest accolade given to the most outstanding cadets who have displayed exceptional leadership qualities and have made extensive contributions to their units in school and at HQ-NCDCC at the national level. Well done to our cadet!  
  
In addition, 9 NCDCC cadets also performed a sand art piece titled 'Our NCDCC Story: From School to SCDF' which portrays the journey of LTA Jadyn Toh, who started her journey as a NCDCC cadet and continued volunteering as a NCDCC volunteer and being accepted as a SCDF regular today.
