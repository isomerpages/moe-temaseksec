Our school held its 40th Annual Speech Day on 16 April 2021, to celebrate the success and achievements of our students, alumni and also staff for the year of 2020. Former Principal, Mrs Dayna Chia, graced the event as the Guest-of-Honour and handed out the awards and prizes to recognise the recipientsâ€™ dedication and excellence in the academic and Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) areas. Staff and parents who have contributed to the growth of TMS were also given recognition for their outstanding service.

  

We would like to thank everyone who has helped and rallied on to celebrate the achievements and contributions of our students, staff and partners. To all our awardees, congratulations! Best wishes for your future endeavours!
