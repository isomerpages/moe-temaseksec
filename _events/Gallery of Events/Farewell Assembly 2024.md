<p>Last Friday, the Sec 4 and 5 came together to spend a special moment to
reminisce about the years they spent as a Temasek family. The Farewell
Assembly was a mix of joy and nostalgia as we recognized their tremendous
journey.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This journey has been about more than just academics; it has been a time
of personal development, laughter, and forming bonds that will last a lifetime.
The Sec 4/5s have faced challenges, shared countless moments of fun, and
built friendships that have remained steadfast. As they now prepare to
face the national exams, it’s an opportunity to appreciate all they’ve
achieved. The farewell assembly captured this beautifully—complete with
inspiring performances, the presentation of the Outstanding Student Awards
(OSA), a heartfelt collar pin ceremony, and an impactful address from our
principal. Heartwarming video montages added a touch of nostalgia, while
the lunch buffet that followed was a fitting symbol of the support and
nourishment these students have given one another over the years. Reaching
this milestone is a testament to their hard work, and we couldn’t be prouder
of them.</p>
