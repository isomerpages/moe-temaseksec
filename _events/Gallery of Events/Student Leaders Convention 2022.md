The Student Leaders Convention is a day where all student leaders in Temasek are able to learn important skills and knowledge, as well as to get know leaders from the other leadership groups.  
  
With workshops on Peer Support and Creativity, and fun games (facilitated by the Excos) like the Newspaper Challenge, the Student Councillors, Peer Support Leaders, Sports Captains, Class Managers and the Young Ambassadors learnt and had fun during this training convention!
