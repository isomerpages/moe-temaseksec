<p>Adventure, resilience, and loads of fun! Our Secondary 3 students took
on an action-packed Outdoor Adventure Camp from 21–23 January 2026, with
thrilling activities like kayaking at Pandan Reservoir, conquering fears
at Mega Adventure’s High Elements, trekking across Sentosa, and even cooking
up a storm together! Combined with beach games and team challenges, it
was an incredible experience that strengthened friendships and built leadership
through shared adventure.</p>
