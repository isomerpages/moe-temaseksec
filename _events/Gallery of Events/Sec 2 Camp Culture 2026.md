<p>Our Secondary 2 students had a meaningful and enriching Camp Culture experience
as they explored Singapore through exciting learning journeys to Tiong
Bahru, the Oceanarium in Sentosa, the Eurasian Heritage Gallery, Central
Sikh Gurdwara, the Peranakan Museum, and the Changi Chapel Museum. These
visits brought history, culture, and the idea of conservation, both in
terms of our environment and our natural heritage, to life, helping students
deepen their understanding of our nation’s diverse stories and communities.
The experience was perfectly rounded off with a joyful picnic, giving students
time to bond, reflect, and celebrate their shared learning. A wonderful
blend of discovery, connection, and fun!</p>
