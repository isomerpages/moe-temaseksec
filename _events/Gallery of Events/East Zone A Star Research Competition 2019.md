Our Secondary Three students from the Temasek _Ignis_ Programme (TIP) specialising in Math/Science Research competed in the East Zone A\*Star Research Competition on 2 August 2019. We are very proud to share that the team comprising of Andrew Chong (301), Eunice Goh (301) and Angus Kong (303) have achieved the Silver Award for the East Zone category from a field of 72 teams.  
  
Well done, Temasekians!
