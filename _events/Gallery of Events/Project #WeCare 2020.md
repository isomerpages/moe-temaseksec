28 Feb 2020 was supposed to kick-start our 40th Anniversary celebrations (TMS40) with the first major event for Term 1, the school's 39th Speech Day. Due to COVID-19, we had to suspend the event till further notice.

  

While we continue to work hard to manage COVID-19, we realised that we can still celebrate TMS40 in other meaningful ways. Project #WeCare is the brainchild of the Student Rep Committee, which comprises the presidents and vice presidents of the school's five Student Leadership domains. This is because as part of the student leadership development programme, LEAD@TMS, students are encouraged to contribute to the school and community. Together, they planned to show appreciation to the cleaners who have put in so much hardwork to keep our school and community clean and safe during this battle against COVID-19.

  

During the week of 2 Mar 2020, the student leaders began the planning by interviewing the cleaners to learn more about their lives and also what items would be useful to include in the goodie bags. What followed was a mass outreach to the school to share with all classes on how the school can contribute resources for the goodie bags.

  

Within a week, over a thousand items were collected from students, staff, alumni and parents. To commemorate TMS40, with the help of Southeast CDC, 40 of these goodie bags were presented to cleaners in the Bedok Division under East Coast-Fengshan Town Council and another 16 goodie bags given to the Operations staff and contract cleaners supporting TMS on 12 Mar 2020.

  

As a school, we are thankful to our student leaders for initiating this project and kick-starting TMS40 Celebrations in a meaningful way to serve family, school and nation!
