Annually, Temasek Secondary celebrates the Chinese New Year with a Cross Country Run on the eve of Chinese New Year. This year on 24 Jan 2020, the school decided to do something for the community instead as part of our TMS40 celebrations. Instead of a run, we did Walk For Rice, which allowed staff and Temasekians to donate rice and instant oatmeal to needy families in the community.  
  
We are proud to share that with everyone's effort, we have managed to donate 21,740 bowls of white rice, 21,740 bowls of brown rice and 10,870 bowls of instant oatmeal to needy families. We have indeed exemplified our school motto, We Care, through this. Well done, everyone!
