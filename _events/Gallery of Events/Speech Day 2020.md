Our school's 39th Speech Day event was to be held on 28 Feb 2020. However, it was cancelled due to Covid-19. Nevertheless, we remained committed to honouring all awardees for the Year 2019.

  

Our Top Awardees from Class 2019 were recognised for their achievements on 6 Aug 2020 and 14 Aug 2020. These included outstanding achievements in CCA, Leadership, and Academics. Through a small-group closed door ceremony, these awardees were joined by their parents to celebrate their success.

  

Our current students were recognised for their achievements through class-based platforms held from 17 Jul to 7 Aug 2020.

  

Our heartiest congratulations to all our Awardees and their families! As you continue to excel in life, may you always remember the Temasek Creed and the school values T-EPIC in all that you do. Best wishes to everyone!
