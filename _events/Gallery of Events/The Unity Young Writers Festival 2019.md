Recently, a group of Temasekians from the Temasek&nbsp;_IGNIS_&nbsp;Programme (TIP) participated in The Unity Young Writers Festival 2019 organised by Unity Secondary School. This event provides a platform to celebrate local poetry and nurture our budding student poets. Students were provided with the opportunity to learn and interact with local poets such as Alvin Pang, Charlene Shepherdson, Jennifer Anne Champion, Jollin Tan, and Marc Nair so that they may be inspired to develop and express their voices in writing. The students were then given 6 weeks to write and submit their own original poetry pieces based on the competition theme of nostalgia.

  

We are very happy to share that one of our students, Venetia from Class 204, has emerged first runner-up in the poetry writing competition out of 200 entries from 27 secondary schools.
