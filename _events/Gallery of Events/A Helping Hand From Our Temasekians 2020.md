On 29 Dec 2019, 3 Temasekians (Nur Hakim, Stanley Lau and Mohamed Zulkarnaen from Class 409 \[2020\]) were cycling at East Coast Park when they witnessed a collision between a 7 year old pedestrian and a 16 year old cyclist. The boys stopped to help by applying first aid to both the cyclist and the pedestrian. As the cyclist needed further medical aid, the three boys called for an ambulance and stayed with the cyclist until the paramedics arrived.  
  
Well done boys! You have truly exhibited the school motto of We Care.
