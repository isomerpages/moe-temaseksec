Singapore Science and Engineering Fair (SSEF) is a national research competition organised by MOE, A\*Star and Science Centre, an affiliate to the prestigious International Science and Engineering Fair, which is regarded as the Olympics of Science competitions. We are proud to share that TMS submitted 2 teams from the Science Research Specialisation from the Temasek Ignis Programme.

  

One of the teams, comprising of Rayan, Yixin and Sean, managed to qualify for the Finals and competed against numerous projects of high quality, including those from the Junior College students. Their project, titled 'Conversion of wind from ceiling fans to electricity in Singapore Schools (Primary and Secondary)' required hard work from the students and their teacher mentor, Mr Ethan Tay.

  

Congratulations to TMS and TIP.
