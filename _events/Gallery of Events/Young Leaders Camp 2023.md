The Young Leaders Camp is here again! The 2-day workshop (30-31 May 2023) organised by the Peer Support Leaders have helped more than 270 young leaders from over 13 schools to learn leadership skills and values through fun experiential games! With mediaeval and magical themed activities, it was enjoyable time for both young leaders and old alike!
