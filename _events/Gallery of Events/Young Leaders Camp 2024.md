<p>The Young Leaders Camp is here again! The 2-day workshop (28-29 May 2024)
organised by the Peer Support Leaders, with support from the student leaders
of Temasek, have helped more than 360 young leaders from over 13 primary
schools to learn leadership skills and values through fun experiential
games!</p>
<p></p>
<p>This year's theme was about space and the specially designed activities
was an enjoyable time for the many young leaders!</p>
