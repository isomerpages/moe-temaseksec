<p>On 26 September 2025, our Sec 4 and Sec 5 students came together for a
meaningful Farewell Assembly, a time to reflect on their shared journey
as part of the Temasek family. The event was filled with warmth, pride
and a touch of nostalgia as we celebrated their remarkable growth.</p>
<p>Over the years, this journey has been so much more than academics. It
has been a season of self-discovery, laughter, perseverance and friendships
that will last a lifetime. As our graduating students prepare for their
national exams, the assembly provided a heartfelt pause to honour all they
have achieved together.</p>
<p>The morning featured inspiring performances by Mr Boo Yong Feng and the
Form Teachers, the presentation of the Outstanding Student Awards (OSA),
a meaningful collar pin ceremony, and an uplifting address by our Principal
and the Student Council President. Moving video montages captured treasured
memories, while a celebratory buffet lunch symbolised the support and camaraderie
that have defined their time here.</p>
<p>Reaching this milestone reflects their dedication and resilience, and
we could not be prouder of every one of them!</p>
