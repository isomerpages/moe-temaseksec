TMS organised our annual Career Guidance Day (CGD) on 5 April 2022. We hosted speakers from the various tertiary institutions such as Junior Colleges, Polytechnics and Institute of Technical Education (ITE) to help our Temaseksians explore the multiple education pathways available. Our School Advisory Committee (SAC) members and parents were also invited to share about their respective careers and this allowed our students to understand how academic, professional and employability skills are needed to prepare themselves for the 21st century. This is part of TMS Education and Career Guidance (ECG) efforts to equip our students with the necessary knowledge, skills and values to make informed decisions at each key education stage for successful transition from school to further education.
