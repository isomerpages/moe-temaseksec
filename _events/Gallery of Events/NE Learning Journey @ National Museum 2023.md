Every Secondary 4 student played their part in being a big brother and sister to their Sec 1 juniors as part of their VIA project! The VIA Leaders and their classmates spent a term putting together a learning journey and brought the Sec 1s through a learning of Singapore's history at the National Museum as part of the Sec 1 Camp programme on 16 and 17 May 2023!
