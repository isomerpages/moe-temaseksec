<p>It is Temasek's 24th Student Leaders Investiture!</p>
<p>We are thrilled to celebrate the appointment of the Secondary 2 and 3
newly invested student leaders from the five leadership groups (Student
Councillors, Peer Support Leaders, Sports Captains, Class Managers, and
Young Ambassadors), House Captains and the Exco members.</p>
<p>We are also proud to announce the Alumni Leader of the Year Awards from
the five leadership groups and extend our heartfelt gratitude to the outgoing
student leaders, whose hard work and passion have inspired their peers
and left a lasting impact on our school.</p>
<p>Their enthusiasm and dedication to their roles have fostered a vibrant
and inclusive school community!</p>
