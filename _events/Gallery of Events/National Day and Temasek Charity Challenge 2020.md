Temasek Secondary School commemorated National Day in meaningful ways this week. Continuing our tradition of giving back to the community since 2005, we celebrated National Day through our annual Temasek Charity Challenge! Even though we could not take to streets and could only raise funds in school, with support from staff and students, we managed to raise over $3,300 for charities supported by the Presidentâ€™s Challenge!

  

TAG also shared a smooth rendition of "Home" and our Young Ambassadors led classes in appreciating our National Day Songs past and present. We gave out prizes for winners of the #SYFstrongertogether competition where our students had the opportunity to express their gratitude and well wishes for our nation during these challenging times.

  

Our NCDCC cadets also shared how we can be better prepared in an emergency through the myResponder app. We also congratulated our CCA award winners on their contributions and achievements.

  

Indeed it was a packed hour of celebrations. We wish all a wonderful National Day!
