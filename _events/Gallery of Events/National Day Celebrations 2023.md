This National Day, TMS held its National Day Observance Ceremony with the support of its three Uniformed Groups, the National Cadet Corps (NCC), the National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) and the National Civil Defence Cadet Corps (NCDCC). The ceremony was led by 3SG (NCC) Aaron Chua Ming Hong.

The Young Ambassadors also planned an exciting assembly programme where students participated in quizzes, sang along to our favourite National Day songs and enjoyed the wonderful performance by TAG!

National Day celebrations also takes on a new meaning at Temasek as we channel the spirit of giving through the Temasek Charity Challenge, our annual fund-raising event. Guided by the Peer Support Leaders, our passionate Upper Secondary students hit the streets to raise funds for the President's Challenge!

Back in school, the energetic Sec 1s participated in the Go MAD (Go Make A Difference) initiative, turning our school into a lively hub of generosity and joy. Supported by our Class Managers, the classes offered an array of heartwarming care packages and engaging carnival-styled games!
