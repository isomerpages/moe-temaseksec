Our Secondary Three TIPpers (Students from the Temasek _IGNIS_ Programme) have recently taken part in the Prudential Young Trailblazers Competition where their entry had impressed the judges and was recognised as the Best Business Plan and Best Pitch. Through this journey, they have exhibited values of teamwork, resilience and performance excellence. Well done, TIPpers!
