<p>Temasek Secondary School came together to honour the dedication and care
of our teachers and staff on <strong>All Staff Day</strong>. This special
occasion recognises the invaluable contributions of both teaching and non-teaching
staff in shaping the growth and success of every Temasekian.</p>
<p>To show their gratitude, classes organised heartfelt celebrations, while
students from the seven Houses staged vibrant performances for their teachers.
Adding a personal touch, our Parent Support Group created beautiful art
pieces for each member of staff.</p>
<p>It was truly a day filled with joy, appreciation, and smiles! A memorable
celebration of the people who make a difference every day at Temasek Secondary
School.</p>
