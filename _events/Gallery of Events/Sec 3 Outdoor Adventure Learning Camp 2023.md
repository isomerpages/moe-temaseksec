As the sun sets on an incredible journey, our amazing students bid farewell to the Secondary Three Resilience Camp, cherishing the everlasting memories they've forged. Together, they triumphed over personal battles, bolstered by the unwavering support of friends, teachers, and inspiring camp instructors.

These past three days were a whirlwind of adventure, laughter, and pure joy, leaving smiles etched on the faces of many. From challenging activities that pushed limits to heartwarming moments of camaraderie, every experience added a chapter to their story of resilience.

Grateful for the bonds forged, the lessons learned, and the strength discovered within, we salute our extraordinary students as they step into the rest of the year, armed with unforgettable memories from an incredible camp that will forever shape their lives.
