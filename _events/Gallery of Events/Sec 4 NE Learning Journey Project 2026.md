<p>On 19 &amp; 20 January 2026, our Secondary 4 students stepped up as mentors
by bringing their Secondary 1 juniors on a meaningful learning journey
to the Supreme Court Heritage Gallery, Parliament Connect Museum, and the
URA Gallery. Through these visits, our seniors guided their juniors in
discovering how Singapore’s legal system, governance, and urban planning
shape our nation. More than just a learning trip, it was a wonderful opportunity
for cross-level bonding, leadership in action, and learning beyond the
classroom. Thank you, Sec 4s, for leading by example and making this experience
inspiring and memorable for our Sec 1s!</p>
