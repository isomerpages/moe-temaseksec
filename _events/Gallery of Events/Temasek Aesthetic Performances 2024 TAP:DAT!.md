<p>Our talented Aesthetic CCAs put up combined concerts to celebrate the
beauty and inspiration from the performing arts! Held on 13 April 2024
(Sat) at Victoria Theatre, the more than 500 audiences were treated to
an evening of entertaining performances.</p>
<p></p>
<p>SeriousPlay put up two plays on: one on the perils of being a supernatural
being in the modern world and the other about the importance of understanding
our unique strengths!... as animals...</p>
<p>The Temasek Freestylers performed two Japanese themed dances that were
executed with precision and beautiful choreography, while the Temasek Acappella
Group jumped on the bandwagon of recent artistes that were in Singapore
and sand songs from the repertoire of Taylor Swift and Bruno Mars!</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was truly an evening to remembers!</p>
