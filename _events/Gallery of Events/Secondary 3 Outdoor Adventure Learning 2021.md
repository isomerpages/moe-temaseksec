The school conducted a 3 day Outdoor Adventure Learning (OAL) for the Secondary 3 cohort from 26-28 January 2021. During these 3 days, students had the opportunity to apply their learning from the Outdoor Education in Physical Education (OE in PE) and Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) to the various activities that they participated during the OAL. Set within an environment that is away from the urban cityscape of Singapore, students are led through various outdoor activities, such as kayaking, orienteering and conquering the high elements. These activities not only enhanced their confidence and resilience but also sharpened their critical and problem-solving skills as they analysed the situations they were in and made decisions as a team.
