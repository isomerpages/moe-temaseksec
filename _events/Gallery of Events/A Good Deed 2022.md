Recently, our Temasekian, Muhammad Aniq Hilman (Class 407), who had recently stepped down as Staff Sergeant of the school's National Civil Defence Cadet Corps (NCDCC), was with a friend when they were called upon for help. Both of them quickly and selflessly helped an elderly man who had suffered a fall and sustained some injuries. With Aniq's quick thinking, he applied first aid and calmed the elderly man. Aniq also very calmly gave instructions to his friend on how they could help the elderly man up to his bed so that the elderly man could be more comfortable while waiting for the paramedics to arrive. We are very proud of you, Aniq for upholding the Temasek values of T-EPIC (Teamwork, Performance Excellence, Integrity, Care) and our School Motto, We Care.
