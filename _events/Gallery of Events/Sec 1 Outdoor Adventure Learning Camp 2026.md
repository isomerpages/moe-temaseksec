<p>Our Secondary 1 students had an unforgettable time at their Outdoor Adventure
Camp from 21–23 January 2026! From paddling hard in dragon boats along
the Kallang River, scaling new heights at Climb Central, trekking through
Mount Faber, to soaking up the sun with games at Sentosa Beach, it was
three days packed with excitement, teamwork, and laughter. A fantastic
way for our Sec 1s to bond, challenge themselves, and kickstart their secondary
school journey with confidence and joy!</p>
