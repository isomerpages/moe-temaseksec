<p>Our inaugural Inter House Sports Carnival was successfully completed on
Friday 17 May 2024.</p>
<p>Students from the 7 different houses competed in 9 different sports, including
a cheering competition.</p>
<p>Gold medals will be awarded to the winners of the 9 sports and points
tally from the performance of all the house teams will determine the overall
house champion who will be presented with the House Challenge Cup.</p>
<p>It was heartening to see Temasekians in action, and values like sportsmanship
and respect on display. Through competition, we hope that our students
are able to learn to lose with grace or win with humility.</p>
