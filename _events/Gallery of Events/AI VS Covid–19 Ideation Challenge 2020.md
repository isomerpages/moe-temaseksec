The COVID-19 pandemic has affected everyone, claiming hundreds of thousands of lives and disrupting the livelihood of millions.


AI has the potential to transform our economy and improve lives. Given this unprecedented global crisis, an ideation challenge was launched by AI Singapore, with the aim to encourage the curation of innovative ideas using AI methods and technologies to improve people’s lives during and after the pandemic.
