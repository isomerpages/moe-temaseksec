<p>Our 2nd Inter-House Sports Carnival wrapped up in spectacular fashion
on Thursday, 29 May 2025!</p>
<p>Students from all 7 houses brought their A-game across 8 thrilling sports
events — and yes, even the cheering competition was fierce!</p>
<p>Gold medals will soon be awarded to the champions of each sport, but the
ultimate glory lies in the points tally. Achievements here will contribute
to points tally to claim the coveted <strong>House Challenge Cup</strong>!</p>
<p>It was truly inspiring to watch our Temasekians in action — displaying
not just skill, but also values like <strong>sportsmanship, teamwork, and respect</strong>.
Whether in victory or defeat, they reminded us all that learning to win
with humility and lose with grace is what real champions are made of.</p>
