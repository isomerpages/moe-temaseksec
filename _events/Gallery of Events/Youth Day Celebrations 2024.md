<p>Temasek Secondary School celebrated Youth Day with BUDDY DAY! On this
day, Temasekians celebrated this special day by getting their friends to
dress up together as either iconic duos, groups or just as friends!</p>
<p>This celebration of friendship began with a sharing on how to make friends
by our Sports Captain chairman, Aryan, and concluded with an amazing assembly
organised by the Student Rep Committee. The assembly featured a games,
a singalong session and amazing performances by students and teachers (and
Principal!) alike!</p>
<p>Together with a special ice-cream treat and a beautiful house file, Buddy
Day/Youth Day was indeed a celebration to remember!</p>
