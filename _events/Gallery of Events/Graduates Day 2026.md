<p>14 Jan 2026 was the day our Temasekians, batch of 2025, came back to collect
their O Level results. The bustling hall was full of students and their
parents, eagerly waiting for 2pm to finally see the fruit of their four
year's labour. Congratulations to all! Go forth bravely to experience the
next chapter of your lives, dearest Temasekians! We will always be there
for you, cheering you on.</p>
