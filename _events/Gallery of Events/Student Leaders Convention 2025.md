<p>The Student Leaders Convention has returned!</p>
<p>Student leaders from all leadership groups came together to learn about
leadership on 7 March 2025!</p>
<p>Mr. Keith Yap, founder and creator of The Frontrow Podcast, graced the
event as keynote speaker and shared his thoughts on how youth can be effective
as leaders!</p>
<p>Students had the chance to participate in workshops that focused on Peer
Support Relations and Design Thinking. The Temasek Alumni organized a thrilling
mass game that brought plenty of fun and excitement to the day. To top
it all off, the event concluded with the fantastic Nite’s Out, featuring
outstanding and entertaining dance performances by the Sec 4s and 5s. The
SLC was an unforgettable day filled with both learning and celebration!</p>
