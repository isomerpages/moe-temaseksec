# Movie Nite 2023
It's the end of the Term 1 and it's time to give everyone a well deserved break together AND do our part for charity!

Temasek Secondary School held Movie Nite: Jumanji with a time filled with friends, food and fun!
Everybody had a good time watching Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle with great food and entertainment provided by our students leaders and Parent Support Group who brought plenty of snacks!
This event also raised funds for the President's Challenge and was a time for the school together for a great cause!
