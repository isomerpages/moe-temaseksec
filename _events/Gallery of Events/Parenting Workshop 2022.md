Is your child spending too much time on their digital devices? What can parents do to build a positive digital family culture together with their child?  
  
Today, we kickstarted the first of our Digital Parenting Workshop series with our Temasek parents, in collaboration with TOUCH Community Services.  
We also had our Peer Support Leaders share their experience of good digital family routines and effective communication with their parents.
