Our Normal Course students went through three full days of Elective modules, covering areas such as Baking and Barista, Sports and Wellness, DJ and Sound Engineering, Aerospace Engineering and Drones Piloting and Airline Services. The students gained a lot of insight into the industries behind these skills, and picked up useful skills for future studies. The students excitedly showcased what they had learned on 10 Jan 2020 to their teachers and peers by sharing pastries and desserts, and letting their teachers and students have a first class in-flight service.
