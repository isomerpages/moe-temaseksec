<p>The Student Leaders Convention is back again!</p>
<p>Mr Dylan Sharma, Co-Founder and Director of TRICOM Events, graced the
occasion and delivered the keynote on Hope &amp; Resilience.</p>
<p>Student Leaders also had the opportunity to learn about Peer Support Relations
and Design Thinking through workshops.</p>
<p>A mass game organised by the Temasek Alumni was incredibly fun and enjoyable.
And the day wrapped up with the amazing Niteâ€™s Out, with superb and entertaining
dances by the Sec 4s and 5s.</p>
<p>The SLC was an incredible day of learning and celebration!</p>
