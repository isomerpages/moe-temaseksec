Four years of hard work and unforgettable memories have led us to this moment. As we gathered for our Sec 4 and 5 farewell assembly last Friday, it was a bittersweet feeling to realize how far they've come.

In these four to five years, they've not only grown academically but also as individuals. The Sec 4/5s had their fair share of fun, learned new things, and most importantly, they've made lifelong friends who have been by our side through thick and thin. Now, as we stand on the threshold of the national exams, it's time to reflect on the incredible journey. The farewell assembly beautifully closed this four-year chapter with mesmerizing performances, the prestigious collar pin ceremony, heartwarming video montages, the presentation of the Outstanding Student Awards (OSA), and our principal's inspiring address. The delicious lunch buffet was the cherry on top, symbolizing the nourishment they've received from each other's friendship and support. We are incredibly proud of all of them for reaching this milestone.
