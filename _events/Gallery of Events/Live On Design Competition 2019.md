The Secondary Three Art students had recently participated in the ‘Live On Design Competition (LODC) organised by the National Organ Transplant Unit (NOTU). The LODC 2019 is part of NOTU’s pilot trial to integrate learning and compassion into school’s curriculum through organ transplant donation and transplantation. Out of 262 entries, the Organisation shortlist 30 winners. We have 5 students from TMS who won the Merit, Special and Distinction awards.  

  

The winners are:

Lin Zhi Yao (307) - Merit, Ng Xi Yi (305) - Merit, Merrilyn Tan (305) - Merit, Haris Suhaimi (305) - Special, Fatin Batrisya (307) - Distinction

  

Through the design competition, students not only explore their ideas with a different perspective, they also gain insights on the delicate and emotive nature of organ donation and transplantation. Congratulations, Temasekians!
