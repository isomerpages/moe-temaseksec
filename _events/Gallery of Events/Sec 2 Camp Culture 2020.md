Since 2018, Camp Culture evolved to enhance students' understanding and appreciation of "culture" in Singapore. This 3-day non- residential learning experience, from 7-9 Jan 2020, is designed to help students appreciate the multiculturalism of Singapore and deepen understanding of Singapore's approach to overcoming its challenges through gleaning first hand information on the Singapore identity and the heritage of her diverse communities.

  

Students visited the Kranji War Memorial, Red Hill Heritage, Gurdwara Sahib Sikh Temple and Nagore Dargah Indian Muslim Heritage Centre. Students then returned to school to have facilitated discussion to promote perspective taking and student agency.
