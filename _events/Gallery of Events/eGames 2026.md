<p>Temasek Secondary School came alive with excitement as students gathered
for this year’s E-Games! Featuring popular titles like Brawl Stars, Mobile
Legends, and Mario Kart, the event brought together gamers across levels
for a day of friendly competition and shared fun. Teams strategised intensely
in Mobile Legends, quick reflexes were put to the test in Brawl Stars,
and laughter filled the room during thrilling races in Mario Kart. Beyond
the competition, the event fostered sportsmanship, teamwork, and camaraderie
among students. It was more than just gaming, it was about connection,
celebration, and creating memorable moments together. A truly fun and enjoyable
experience for all!</p>
