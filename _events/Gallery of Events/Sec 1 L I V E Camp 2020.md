To create more opportunities for the Secondary 1 students to get to know their peers and form teachers beyond Orientation, they went for the Sec 1 L.I.V.E. Camp from 7 Jan to 9 Jan 2020. During the camp, the students were led by their Secondary 4 seniors on a learning journey to S.E.A. Aquarium and National Museum of Singapore to learn more about marine life and Singapore's past. They also had an authentic learning experience for Mathematics at Gardens By The Bay. Students also challenged the high element course at the Boys/Girls Brigade campsite.
