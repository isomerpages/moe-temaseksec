As part of our National Day Celebrations, our Secondary Two to Five Temasekians took to the streets around Singapore to raise funds for the beneficiaries of the President's Challenge.  
  
Our Temasekians were glad to have this opportunity to give back to society and were also heartened by the public's generosity which saw them raising about $23,000 in just one day.
