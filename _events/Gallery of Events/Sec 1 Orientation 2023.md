The Sec 1s learnt more about what it means to be Temasekian in the 4-day Sec 1 Orientation Programme conducted by the Student Councillors, Peer Support Leaders, Sports Captains, Class Managers and Young Ambassadors. In spite of the many challenges faced in these challenging times, the Sec 1s enjoyed themselves and became a part of the Temasek Family.  
  
This video is a short but powerful story of the experience our Sec 1s had during the Sec 1 Orientation.
