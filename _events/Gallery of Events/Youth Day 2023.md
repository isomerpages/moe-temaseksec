## Bring Your Toy Day
It is a Youth Day and it is a time to celebrate everything exciting about being a youth. Everyone loves toys and everybody brought their toys to school! Toys are also a great way to help manage mental health as they are a source of comfort and security! Prizes were given out to the largest, most unique and most like toys from the Student Rep Committee. Every student was already given a treat with ice-cream and were able to keep cool with a USB-battery powered fan! Overall, everyone had a great day for Youth Day!
