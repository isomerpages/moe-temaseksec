The Temasek Secondary School's student councillors orchestrated a dazzling prom night at Orchard Rendezvous on November 21, 2023. The theme was Enchanted Forest and the ball room was transformed into a glamorous haven, where students experienced a night of sophistication and camaraderie! The evening included a photo booth capturing candid moments and a culinary buffet spread that delighted the taste buds. With support from the Parent Support Group, the school and organised by the amazing Student Councillors, Grad Night became a cherished memory for all.
