With hearts full of pride, we bid farewell to our incredible Secondary One students, who have concluded their 3D2N overnight camp, an experience filled with triumphs and personal growth. For some, it was their initial foray into the world of overnight camps, and they showed nothing less than tremendous courage and resilience. They faced challenges head-on, persevering through every hurdle with unwavering determination.

Over the course of three action-packed days, these young adventurers were brought even closer together by a series of exciting activities such as dragon boating and orienteering at Sentosa. They stood together, supporting and encouraging each other throughout the various activities, learning that they could achieve much more together than apart. Laughter echoed, friendships flourished, and memories were made that will last a lifetime.

We couldn't be prouder of our incredible Sec 1s for giving their all and embracing every opportunity to learn, grow, and etch lasting memories into their secondary school journey. Let the spirit of this camp guide you as you continue to soar towards your next peaks of excellence
