<p>Temasek Secondary School restarted the overseas trips in 2024!</p>
<p>One of the trips is the augural Leadership (Entrepreneurship) Trip (LET)
to Thailand was held at Bangkok from 31 May to 5 June 2024, with 30 student
leaders from all five groups attending it. With visits to Kubota Farm (Japan),
Holiday Inn Express (America) and Boon Tong Kee (Singapore), the team visited
companies that expanded their business into Thailand to learn from them
key considerations in how they adapted their business to the local market.
The team also learnt important ways that Bangkok adapted their businesses
to keep up with a changing market and how they successfully transitioned
from a cultural focus to a commercial enerprise.</p>
<p>The team also visited Chulalongkorn University Demonstration Secondary
School and learnt from their student leaders how their leadership programmes
are conducted.</p>
<p>With reflections every night that covered key business principles and
the school's Cross-Cultural Awareness (C2A) curriculum, the trip was an
incredible success!</p>
