Today was such an amazing day at Temasek School! It was the perfect chance for all of us to show our appreciation for the incredible care and hard work we've had from teachers and staff. From fun class bonding activities to an awesome assembly program, the entire school came together to celebrate our amazing teachers and students. All Staff Day was a true celebration of the impact our teachers and staff have on our lives!

And a HUGE shout out to the absolutely amazing PSG parents who went above and beyond to create beautiful bottle gifts for all the staff members at our school! Your thoughtfulness and generosity truly made our day even more special. Thank you for your incredible support and dedication to our school community!
