<p>Temasek celebrated SG60 with our National Day celebrations!</p>
<p></p>
<p>The day started off with a National Day Observance Ceremony where the
school reflected on Singapore's independence.</p>
<p>It was then followed by an exciting assembly programme organised by our
Young Ambassadors. The school sang along to our favourite National Day
songs, participated in quizzes about Singapore and enjoyed wonderful performances
by TAG.</p>
<p>The day rounded up with Temasek MagicLand, a celebration carnival of Temasek
Primary and Temasek Secondary's 45th Anniversary!</p>

<p>Majulah Singapura!</p>
