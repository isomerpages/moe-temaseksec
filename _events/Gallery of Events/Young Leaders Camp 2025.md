<p>Held on 4–5 June 2025, this exciting 2-day workshop — organised by our
dedicated Peer Support Leaders with strong support from Temasek’s student
leaders — welcomed <strong>over 320 young leaders</strong> from <strong>more than 16 primary schools</strong>!</p>
<p>Through a series of fun, hands-on activities, participants explored key <strong>leadership skills and values</strong> in
an engaging, meaningful way.</p>
<p>This year’s <strong>space-themed</strong> camp launched young minds into
a world of learning and adventure — and judging by the energy and enthusiasm,
it was an unforgettable experience for all involved!</p>
