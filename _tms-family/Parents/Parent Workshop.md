We have organised a series of parenting workshops in conjunction with TOUCH Cyber Wellness for you to attend with your child! Hear from experienced facilitators and our Peer Support Leaders, who will be sharing from the perspective of students on various issues such as mitigating risks of screentime usage and how they overcome failures.
