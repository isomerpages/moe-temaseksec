There will be consequences for students who misbehave or commit offence/s that contravene the Temasek Creed and/or School Rules.

The school reserves the right to confiscate students’ mobile phones as a disciplinary measure if they contravene the school’s mobile phone regulations or for the purpose of investigation.
