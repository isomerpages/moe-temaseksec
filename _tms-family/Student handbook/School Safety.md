You will be going to the Science Laboratory to participate in practical lessons that will help you understand your topics better and prepare you for your practical assessments. As you will use breakable equipment, gas burners and chemicals, you will need to observe certain rules to ensure the safety of your peers and yourself.

### GENERAL RULES


1.  Do not enter the science laboratory without the teacher’s permission.
2.  Do not eat or drink in the science laboratory.
3.  Do not run around in the science laboratory.
4.  Do not carry out any experiment without the teacher’s permission.
5.  Do not tamper with the electrical mains and other fittings in the laboratory.
6.  Read the instructions carefully before you start the experiment. If in doubt, ask your teacher before you proceed.
7.  Do not smell the gases unless instructed by the teacher. Do not breathe in any gas deeply.
8.  Do not taste any chemical unless the teacher gives permission.
9.  Use apparatus and equipment correctly and carefully.
