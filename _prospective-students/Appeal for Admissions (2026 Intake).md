<h4><strong>AY 2026 Sec 1 Appeal for transfer into TMS</strong></h4>
<p>Congratulations on receiving your Secondary school posting. If you wish
to apply for transfer into Temasek Secondary School, please fill in this&nbsp;
<a href="https://go.gov.sg/tms-appeal-sec1-2026" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">form</a>. The applicant's PSLE score must meet the school's Achievement
Level (AL) for the relevant Posting Group (PG).</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong>
</p>
<p>The personal information provided in this form will be solely used for
the purpose of appealing for secondary school transfer based on non-medical
reasons.</p>
<p>For appeals based on medical reasons (serious medical conditions or severe
physical impairments), please request through the posted school by 12pm
on the following working day after the release of posting results.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your interest and appeal in our school for the Sec 1 2026
intake. Transfers will be subject to available vacancies and the school’s
admission criteria.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The deadline for the submission of appeals is on 26 December 2025, 10:00am.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>We regret that we are unable to consider late submissions.</strong>
</p>
<p>Students who were posted to school via DSA will not be eligible for transfer
appeals.</p>
<p>Students who are appealing to transfer out should still report to the
posted secondary school on 2 January 2026, pending results of the transfer
appeal. Due to the large number of applications expected, please consider
your appeal unsuccessful if you do not hear from the school by 2 January
2026.</p>
