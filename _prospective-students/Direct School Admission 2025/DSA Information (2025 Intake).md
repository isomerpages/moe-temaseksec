<p><strong>Direct School Admission-Secondary (DSA-Sec) Exercise</strong>
</p>
<p>At Temasek Secondary School, we are guided by our school motto “We Care”
to provide a nurturing and inclusive environment that develops every child
holistically. To us, each child is unique and providing them with the optimum
learning experiences would bring out their talent and imbue them with the
character and values that would enable them to thrive and learn for life.
Here, we are always on the lookout for driven individuals who demonstrate
character traits like resilience and empathy as well as cherish our school
values of Teamwork, Performance Excellence, Integrity and Care to join
our school through the Direct Schools Admission (DSA) exercise held once
each year.</p>
