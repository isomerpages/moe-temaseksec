## Direct School Admission to Secondary 1 for 2024

**Direct School Admission-Secondary (DSA-Sec) Exercise**

At Temasek Secondary School, we are guided by our school motto “We Care” to provide a nurturing and inclusive environment that develops every child holistically. To us, each child is unique and providing them with the optimum learning experiences would bring out their talent and imbue them with the character and values that would enable them to thrive and learn for life. Here, we are always on the lookout for driven individuals who demonstrate character traits like resilience and empathy as well as cherish our school values of Teamwork, Performance Excellence, Integrity and Care to join our school through the Direct Schools Admission (DSA) exercise held once each year.

Primary 6 students are welcome to participate in the DSA-Sec Exercise and successful applicants will join Temasek Secondary School in January 2024.&nbsp;&nbsp;
