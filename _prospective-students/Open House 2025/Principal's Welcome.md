<br>Welcome to Temasek Secondary School (TMS)!</p>
<p><strong>Congratulations!</strong>If your child is in Primary 6 this year,
congratulations!&nbsp; Many of us might recall how our children had to
adjust throughout most of their lower primary years due to COVID-19 – wearing
masks, observing safe-distancing, and attending home-based learning.&nbsp;
It is a testament to the determined and consistent efforts of educators
in primary schools, your strong partnership with your child’s primary school,
and your child’s resilience that s/he adapted to those changes and will
soon complete the PSLE.</p>
<p>While we have stepped out of the shadows of COVID-19, clouds of uncertainty
loom ahead.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;New power dynamics within and between large
nations have started to rock the rules-based order which upholds free trade
and multilateralism.&nbsp; Technologies such as generative artificial intelligence
promise greater productivity at work but also threaten to displace jobs
across sectors, including entry and middle-level jobs in professions.</p>
<p><strong>What we offer</strong>In the face of such uncertainty, we at TMS
seek to provide a stable and caring environment that enables your child
to be a joyful learner and exemplary leader.</p>
<p><strong>“We care”</strong>, a motto that has become a signature phrase
among our students, parents and alumni, guides what we do as a school.&nbsp;
We believe in nurturing the whole child and in working closely with parents
and stakeholders to achieve this.&nbsp; Our efforts are guided by the <strong>WE CARE</strong> framework
(see image below), which we develop with reference to MOE initiatives (e.g.
Character and Citizenship Education 2021) and findings from positive psychology
(particularly the six elements of PERMAH, namely Positive emotions, Engagement,
Relationships, Meaning, Accomplishment and Health).&nbsp; For instance,
in line with Wellness, we start school at 8am daily, to allow Temasekians
to have sufficient sleep and time to have breakfast before coming to school.</p>

<p>The culture of care in TMS forms the foundation for our students to learn
and grow in character. &nbsp;We seek to develop six <strong>GROWTH</strong> learning
dispositions (see image above), which we view as essential for your child
to thrive in post-secondary education and the workplace.&nbsp; To develop
these learning dispositions, we provide a variety of platforms for our
students to grow, stretch themselves and lead others.&nbsp; Allow me to
share two examples.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><u>Stretching themselves</u></em>
</p>
<p>Students who wish to delve deeper in certain subjects/ areas can be part
of the <a href="https://www.temaseksec.moe.edu.sg/distinctive-programme/temasek-ignis-programme-tip/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Temasek Ignis Programme</a> (TIP).&nbsp;
Besides approaching specific topics with greater rigour, students in TIP
will have the opportunity to tackle issues from multiple perspectives and
communicate confidently in contexts beyond the classroom.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><u>Leading others&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u></em>
</p>
<p>We do not believe in self-aggrandising leadership that seeks to pursue
ends at all costs, which unfortunately has reared its head in a world that
has become more isolationist.&nbsp; Instead, we believe that leaders of
Singapore need to care for others, build positive relationships, make responsible
decisions and contribute positively to society.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.temaseksec.moe.edu.sg/student-leadership-lead-tms/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">LEAD@TMS</a>,
our student leadership programme, is anchored on our school values of T-EPIC
(Teamwork, Performance Excellence, Integrity, Care).&nbsp; It provides
multiple avenues for students to develop leadership competencies while
contributing to the school community.&nbsp; Whether it’s Class Managers
planning bonding activities for the class, Peer Support Leaders equipping
Temasekians to look out for their peers, House Captains leading Physical
Education Lessons, Young Ambassadors running events that promote active
citizenry, or Student Councillors leading key school events including Sec
1 Investiture – there is something for your child to grow in leadership
perspectives and skills if s/he is keen.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>It's all about the people</strong>
</p>
<p>As a school that turns 45 this year, TMS takes pride in being an autonomous
school that provides a caring and positive learning environment for students
regardless of course or posting group.&nbsp; The fond memories shared by
alumni, many of whom continue to visit or serve the school (e.g. as staff
or School Advisory Committee members), testify to the lives that have flourished
during their time here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We wish you and your child all the best as you search for a secondary
school that best fits your child’s strengths, interests and aspirations.&nbsp;
And if TMS is one of his/her choices, we look forward to him/her being
part of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1WV1fLMyG4M&amp;t=1s" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Temasek Story</a> come
2026.</p>
<p>Warmest regards</p>
<p>Mr. Tan Shun Loong</p>
<p>Principal</p>
