<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<h5>1. Do DSA Student Leaders need to take up a CCA?</h5>
<p>All students will need to have a CCA as CCAs are an integral part of a
holistic education. DSA Student Leaders, like all students, will be assigned
a CCA during the CCA Trials and Allocation Process in Term 1. The CCA assigned
will be based on (1) the student choice, (2) audition/trial outcomes and
(3) the number of vacancies in the CCA.</p>
<h5>2. If my child is accepted under DSA Student Leadership, what will the commitment be like in Temasek Secondary School?</h5>
<p>Student Leaders have timetabled time to have meetings every Monday from
4.00-6.00pm to allow them to have time to be mentored, trained and plan
for events. Student Leaders will also have opportunities to attend training
camps and days throughout the year. Student Leaders will be expected to
organise and facilitate events that they are in charge of.</p>
<p>Do take a look at the LEAD@TMS to have an idea of some events each leadership
group will run.</p>

<h5>3. What are the requirements for a student to apply for DSA Student Leadership? Must an applicant have any student leadership experience (e.g. Prefect, Class Monitor, CCA Leader, etc.) to apply for DSA Student Leadership?</h5>
<p>There are no hard requirements: Applicants <strong><em>do not need to have a leadership role</em></strong> to
be considered for DSA Leadership. However, having leadership experience
will be beneficial as it will help the applicant be able to perform better
during the task assessment.</p>
<p>For example, if an applicant is a Head Prefect in the primary school,
the applicant will likely have some experience in planning and organising
events. These skills will be assessed during the task assessment. The task
assessment is unique to every cohort, but the skills and personal qualities
assessed are the same, as stated in the Pre-Requisites.</p>
<h5>4. How many students are accepted into Temasek Secondary School through DSA Student Leadership?</h5>
<p>Every school is ablet to accept up to 20% of the Sec 1 Cohort via DSA.
The number of students accepted via DSA Student Leadership varies, depending
on the performance of applicants across all DSA Areas (i.e. Choir, Dance,
Drama, Shooting and Student Leadership).</p>

<h5>5. If my child is posted to Temasek Secondary School through DSA, how will my child's academic results affect the stream that he will be assigned?</h5>
<p>From 2024, there will be no more streams for Secondary 1 students. All
applicants will be given a posting group based on the PSLE results. As
our school offers vacancies for all three posting groups, a child (assigned
any posting group) who is offered a place via DSA will be posted to Temasek
Secondary School.</p>

<h5>6. If a child is accepted into Temasek Secondary School via DSA, will he be in TIP (Temask Ignis Programme)?</h5>
<p>TIP is a distinct programme in the school that complements LEAD@TMS. DSA
students will need to apply for TIP when applications are open in Semester
1, just like all other students.</p>
