<p>Primary 6 students who have just received their secondary school posting in 2023 may use this <a href="https://go.gov.sg/tms-appeal-2024" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">form</a>* to appeal for transfer to Temasek Secondary School.</p><p></p><p>Please kindly note that the student’s PSLE score must meet our school’s cut-off point for the relevant posting group. This information is available below. Students who were posted to their posting schools via DSA will not be eligible for application for transfer. Transfers will be subject to available vacancies and the school’s admission criteria. The deadline for the submission of appeals is on 26 December 2023, 10.00am. We regret that we are unable to consider late submissions.</p><p>Please also note that for appeals based on medical reasons (serious medical conditions or severe physical impairments), please submit your request through the posted school by 12pm on the following working day after the release of posting results. Students who are appealing to transfer out should still report to the posted secondary school on 2 January 2024, pending results of the transfer appeal. Due to the large number of applications expected, please consider your appeal unsuccessful if you do not hear from the school by 2 January 2024.</p><p></p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Posting Group</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Cut-Off</p></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>PG1</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>27</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>PG2</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>22</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>PG3</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>12</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p>
