A very warm welcome to Temasek Secondary School (TMS) Open House 2023!

  

As the Principal of TMS, I would like to share with you the few key distinguishing features of TMS that strike me as being very special and important for anyone considering where to go for their secondary education journey.&nbsp;  

  

Firstly, our school Motto is a short and simple –&nbsp;**We Care**. This refers to the spirit of caring, and a strong commitment to all that we undertake as a school community, be it caring for the school, for our staff and schoolmates, the wider community, and also caring about excellence in the work that we do. Through the past few COVID years that have been so challenging, this quality of care has come to the fore, propelling our staff to go the extra mile to work self-sacrificially for the students, and motivating our students to overcome all odds to continue to support and help their friends so that everyone can achieve and move forward together. The spirit of caring unites and strengthens the TMS family in all that we do.

  

The second distinguishing feature of TMS is&nbsp;**strength in diversity**. Our school mission is to provide an environment where Temasekians are nurtured to embrace diversity. As an autonomous school that offers three courses (Express, NA and NT), and as an MOE pilot school – a forerunner of sorts – for the mixing of form classes across three courses, we truly believe that schools should be a vibrant microcosm of wider society. True to our name “Temasek”, this diverse environment helps our students to build a cohesive national identity, grow more holistically and be better prepared to lead and thrive in their future external environment.  

  

Finally, I would like to draw your attention to our&nbsp;**_three distinctive programmes_**&nbsp;that are different from what most other schools provide:&nbsp;&nbsp;**LEAD@TMS**, the&nbsp;**Temasek Ignis Programme (TIP)**, and the&nbsp;**Cross-Cultural Awareness (C2A) Programme**.

  

*   LEAD@TMS is our established leadership programme, and the great focus and emphasis that the school places on this programme is evident in the fact that almost half of our students are selected and trained to be student leaders in various capacities. This programme nurtures a strong sense of responsibility and pride in our students, and influences the entire school tone in a very positive way.&nbsp;  
    

  

*   The Temasek Ignis Programme (TIP) is a talent development programme that nurtures talent and intellectual curiosity in our students. Through a broad based programme at lower secondary and specific areas of specialisation in upper secondary, students gain both breadth and depth of exposure and exploration, and are able to flourish intellectually.  
    

  

*   Finally, the Cross-Cultural Awareness (C2A) Programme emphasises the importance of global awareness and cross-cultural literacy – key dispositions and skills that our students need to thrive in the cosmopolitan 21st century.  
    

  

I hope that these special qualities and programmes of TMS will come through in your experience of our Open House, and we look forward to welcoming you to the TMS family!
