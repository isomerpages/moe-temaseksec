**Ministry of Education Financial Assistance Scheme (MOEFAS)**

This scheme will assist students in:

· Waiver of school fees

· Waiver of standard miscellaneous fees

· Free textbooks

· Free school attire

· Transport allowance

· Meal allowance

**School Advisory Committee (SAC) Fund**

The School Advisory Committee also operates the SAC Fund. Income to the fund is generally derived through fund-raising and donations.

Besides using the fund to support the various activities to engage our students, part of the fund is also used to assist our students who miss the MOEFAS income criteria marginally by providing them textbooks, uniforms, transport and meal allowance.
