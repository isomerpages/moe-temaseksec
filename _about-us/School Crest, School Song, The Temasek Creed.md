Our School Crest has strong historical references. Its main colour – Navy Blue – represents the sea which nostalgically recalls Singapore’s original name ‘Temasek’ (meaning Seaport Town) and from which our alma mater aptly derives her name.  
  
The sea also symbolises the vastness of knowledge which the school imparts and obtains with integrity. The supporting colours are red and gold. Red represents brotherhood and team spirit while gold is symbolic of prosperity and progress.  
  
The motif depicts two lions holding a radiantly burning torch. The lions signify the nation and the school. The torch illuminates the nation’s and school’s ethos of a well-balanced curriculum of education and sports.  
  

### SCHOOL SONG


Lyrics: Mr Koh Beng Thiam  
Music: Mr Paul Seow

We feel for our families  
We strive for our school  
We share with our community  
We stand by our nation.  
For we are Temasekians  
For we are Temasekians  
For we are Temasekians  
And we care.

Our families shall be honoured  
Our school shall be proud  
Our community shall be one  
Our nation shall be free.  
For we are Temasekians  
For we are Temasekians  
For we are Temasekians  
And we care.
