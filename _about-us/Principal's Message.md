<p><strong>Our Temasek Story</strong>
</p>
<p>Current students and staff, as well as recent graduates of Temasek Secondary
School (TMS), would experience or have experienced quite a few infrastructural
enhancements over the last few years (and there will be more to come!).&nbsp;
We also look forward to Bedok South MRT station, one of whose exits is
right outside the school, to be ready this year.</p>
<p>Despite the changes within and around the school, one thing that remains
constant is our commitment to nurture our Temasekians to be joyful learners
and exemplary leaders who will ride on the waves of tomorrow.&nbsp; Allow
me to elaborate on how this commitment is translated into our school programmes
and practices, using the colours of the school crest.</p>
<p><strong><em>Navy blue: Alludes to Temasek, which means Seaport Town; also symbolises the vastness of knowledge which the school seeks to impart to all Temasekians</em></strong>
</p>
<p>We want Temasekians to embody <strong>GROWTH </strong>learning dispositions
– <strong>G</strong>row with others, <strong>R</strong>eflect for improvement, <strong>O</strong>vercome
challenges, <strong>W</strong>ork towards excellence, <strong>T</strong>ake
initiative and (having the) <strong>H</strong>eart for learning.&nbsp; To
that end, we design our curriculum and co-curriculum with GROWTH in mind,
including signature programmes in student leadership development (LEAD@TMS),
cross-cultural awareness (C2A) and talent development (Temasek Ignis Programme),
which equip Temasekians with not just knowledge but also competencies that
will put them in good stead beyond secondary school.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Red: Stands for brotherhood and team spirit that we hope Temasekians will embody</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Imparting knowledge and development of competencies cannot take place
in silos, however.&nbsp; An environment that is steeped in values, supports
the child’s holistic well-being, and enables him/her to flourish individually
and as part of a positive community, is essential.</p>
<p>The environment of TMS is anchored on our values of <strong>T-EPIC</strong> (<strong>T</strong>eamwork, <strong>E</strong>xcellence
in <strong>P</strong>erformance, <strong>I</strong>ntegrity and <strong>C</strong>are).&nbsp;
Of these, Care pervades our school practices and communication with students
and stakeholders.&nbsp; TMS’ motto “We care”, which resonates among our
students, staff, parents and stakeholders, drives our efforts to enhance
holistic student well-being, and is also exhibited by our School Advisory
Committee, Parent Support Group and alumni, whose strong partnership we
cherish.</p>
<p><strong><em>Pair of lions in gold: Represents prosperity and progress that we wish for Singapore and the school</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Visitors to TMS will notice that the entrance to our heritage gallery
is flanked by a wall that proudly displays photographs of some of our graduates
and alumni.&nbsp; These individuals represent a fraction of the many generations
of Temasekians who demonstrate our T-EPIC values and are making significant
contributions to the community and nation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our strong sense of purpose has guided us in nurturing generations of
Temasekians who understand their strengths and interests, work diligently
to realise their aspirations, and contribute meaningfully to the community
around them.&nbsp; We hope to work closely with our parents and stakeholders
to nurture current cohorts of Temasekians, so that they will find relevance
in their learning, purpose in their actions, and significance in their
relationships.</p>
<p>If this purpose resonates with you, we welcome you to be part of the Temasek
Story – a story filled with people who care – and to live out the vivid
colours of Navy Blue, Red and Gold.</p>
<p>We wish you a fruitful 2026!</p>
<p></p>
