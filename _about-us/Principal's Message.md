<p><strong>Our Temasek Story</strong>
</p>
<p>The crest of Temasek Secondary School (TMS), which greets every visitor
entering through the main gate, carries distinct references to Singapore’s
history and conveys aspirations for our students.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Navy blue: Alludes to Temasek, which means Seaport Town; also symbolises the vastness of knowledge which the school seeks to impart to all Temasekians</em></strong>
</p>
<p>The workplace, society and world order of tomorrow will continue to be
shaped by geopolitical forces, technological advancements and demographical
shifts. &nbsp;Trends related to climate change will compel governments
to make trade-offs in terms of decarbonizing the economy, preparing for
rising sea levels and managing food supply disruptions.&nbsp; Issues in
inequality, social mobility and identity politics threaten to fracture
societies if citizens confine themselves to echo chambers and do not anchor
themselves on values.&nbsp;</p>
<p>TMS seeks to develop our students to be joyful learners and exemplary
leaders who will ride on the waves of tomorrow.&nbsp; We want Temasekians
to embody <strong>GROWTH </strong>learning dispositions – <strong>G</strong>row
with others, <strong>R</strong>eflect for improvement, <strong>O</strong>vercome
challenges, <strong>W</strong>ork towards excellence, <strong>T</strong>ake
initiative and (having the) <strong>H</strong>eart for learning.&nbsp; To
that end, we design our curriculum and co-curriculum with GROWTH in mind,
including signature programmes in student leadership development (LEAD@TMS),
cross-cultural awareness (C2A) and talent development (Temasek Ignis Programme),
which equip Temasekians with not just knowledge but also competencies that
will put them in good stead beyond secondary school.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Red: Stands for brotherhood and team spirit that we hope Temasekians will embody</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Imparting knowledge and development of competencies cannot take place
in silos, however.&nbsp; An environment that is steeped in values, supports
the child’s holistic well-being, and enables him/her to flourish individually
and as part of a positive community, is essential.</p>
<p>The environment of TMS is anchored on our values of <strong>T-EPIC</strong> (<strong>T</strong>eamwork, <strong>E</strong>xcellence
in <strong>P</strong>erformance, <strong>I</strong>ntegrity and <strong>C</strong>are).&nbsp;
Of these, Care pervades our school practices and communication with students
and stakeholders.&nbsp; TMS’ motto “We care”, which resonates among our
students, staff, parents and stakeholders, drives our efforts to enhance
holistic student well-being, and is also exhibited by our School Advisory
Committee, Parent Support Group and alumni, whose strong partnership we
cherish.</p>
<p><strong><em>Pair of lions in gold: Represents prosperity and progress that we wish for Singapore and the school</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Visitors to TMS will notice that the entrance to our heritage gallery
is flanked by a wall that proudly displays photos of some of our graduates
and alumni.&nbsp; These individuals represent a fraction of generations
of Temasekians who demonstrate our values of T-EPIC and who are making
significant contributions in the community and nation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As TMS celebrates our 45<sup>th</sup> anniversary in 2025, we welcome you
to be part of the Temasek Story – a story filled with people who care –
and live out the vivid colours of Navy Blue, Red and Gold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We wish you a fruitful 2025!</p>
<p>Mr. Tan Shun Loong</p>
<p>Principal</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
