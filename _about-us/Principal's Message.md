In my second year as Principal of Temasek Secondary School (TMS), I continue to be extremely thankful for the loyal and dedicated teaching and non-teaching staff, the supportive parents and alumni, as well as the enthusiastic, curious and teachable students that we have the privilege of educating.

**THE CONTINUING CHALLENGE OF COVID-19**

It has been more than 2 years of living with COVID-19. Many of the activities that we take for granted as part of routine school life have been disrupted, and have had to be cancelled or conducted in other ways. Instead of looking back wistfully at how life used to be, and putting most things on hold while waiting for the return to normalcy, I think we have to look at COVID-19 in another way.&nbsp;

Speaking at the Singapore Perspectives 2022 forum organized by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS), Health Minister Ong Ye Kung highlights the opportunity for reinvention in a post-COVID world, and likens the COVID-19 crisis to a ‘reset button’ for us all, forcing us to do things in a better, smarter way, and to sharpen and relook our fundamental goals and priorities.&nbsp;**The key question in education, then, is how we can continue to ensure that our young ones continue to meet all the learning objectives that are important to us as parents, and as a society.**&nbsp;

This important question is one that we will continue to wrestle with for the next few years. You would have seen some of these efforts so far, including the full roll out of the&nbsp;**personalised digital learning programme (PDLP)**, under which every secondary school student has received a heavily subsidised laptop or tablet learning device, as well as the regular implementation of&nbsp;**home-based learning (HBL)**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**student-initiated learning**. The personal learning devices, when appropriately used, are powerful means to encourage self-directed learning, enable individualised learning, and ignite the exploration and cultivation of personal interests. Technology, however, also has its concomitant pitfalls that require proactive prevention and intervention. We are therefore focusing a great deal on the issue of&nbsp;**cyber-wellness (closely related to mental health)**, partnering closely with MOE HQ, agencies and parents to do so.&nbsp;

Our school has also pivoted to online formats for key school events and programmes without compromising on the key objectives. For instance, our Open House has taken on an online format with video recordings of our CCA offerings, with small groups of parents and students enjoying virtual school tours led by our student leaders. Our very first online Education and Career Guidance (ECG) day was also conducted in 2021, with much positive feedback received.&nbsp;**In 2022, we will continue these efforts of reimagining the education experience for our students in creative, impactful and sustainable ways.**&nbsp;

**WHAT REMAINS UNCHANGED, OR HAS BECOME EVEN MORE IMPORTANT -&nbsp;FINDING PURPOSE, MEANING, BELONGING AND CONTRIBUTION**

We all need great amounts of resilience, persistence and hope to continue to navigate the pandemic. Another key focus of mine has been&nbsp;**purpose, meaning, belonging and contribution**. German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche famously said, “He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.” This is why&nbsp;**helping our students find a greater purpose and meaning, rooted in a sense of belonging and a desire to contribute, is more critical than ever in this challenging situation.**&nbsp;

One of my deeply-held beliefs about education is articulated as follows:&nbsp;

_“We don’t become better because we acquire new information. We become better because we acquire better loves. We don’t become what we know. Education is a process of love formation. When you go to a school, it should offer you new things to love.”_

―&nbsp;David Brooks,&nbsp;“[The Road to Character](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/42009504)”

St. Augustine speaks of this in a similar way when he describes the re-ordering of loves. Ultimately, education should give one bigger, better things to love. It should not just inculcate the good, but a love for the good. Love for what is good, combined with a personal purpose, therefore serves as the internal motivation for our students to persevere in learning and achieving.&nbsp;

As part of our emphasis on cultivating strong goal-orientation, personal agency, internal motivation and grit in our students, TMS has been adopting a set of&nbsp;**Learning Dispositions (LD)**&nbsp;rubrics since 2019 – in these rubrics, we emphasise qualities such as&nbsp;**pro-activeness, perseverance, discipline in learning, curiosity, openness to feedback, and learning with others****.**&nbsp;These qualities are emphasised by the teachers on a daily basis, and also explicitly taught and developed in our students through programmes and subjects such as Project Culture, school-wide Character and Citizenship Education (CCE), the CCAs, and also the use of personal learning devices for collaboration and self-initiated learning.&nbsp;

**EXCELLENCE IN DIVERSITY**&nbsp;

2022 marks the second year of our journey on the&nbsp;**Common Curriculum**,&nbsp;where lower secondary form classes are mixed across the Express, Normal Academic and Normal Technical courses. The students learn a number of subjects that are less academic in nature together (for instance, music, PE, art, and CCE) in a more diverse classroom environment. However, they are grouped according to their level of progress when they are pursuing the more academic subjects.&nbsp;&nbsp;

In these more diverse form classes, we strive to ensure that students feel known, valued and respected, and we continue to celebrate effort and progress as we differentiate and personalise learning for each student, sometimes with the help of technology. While students with a greater level of needs will receive the support that they need to do their best, this does not come at the expense of the higher progress students, who are still given the resources and opportunities that they require to thrive and to excel. For instance, we have talent development programmes such as the&nbsp;**Temasek Ignis Programme (TIP)**&nbsp;for exposure to and deepening of interests and strengths.&nbsp;

**We are glad to observe, after more than a year of implementing the Common Curriculum, that the students have bonded very well together and their learning experience has been greatly enriched.**&nbsp;

The TMS staff and student community has always been a vibrant and diverse microcosm of Singapore society. We are proud to be one of the forerunners in this national effort to be more inclusive, equitable and embracing of diversity. It is through the forging of a strong and cohesive national identity that cuts across our differences that we can come together, undaunted, to overcome the collective challenges that face us.&nbsp;&nbsp;

In closing, I wish all of you a blessed, healthy and fruitful year ahead.
