In the past year, we have embarked on a re-envisioning process for TMS to co-create our school’s vision for the next 5 years. I wish to thank all students, staff, parents and other stakeholders such as our alumni and School Advisory Committee (SAC) members for your valuable views and insights that are helping to steer the school into our next phase.

From 2023 onwards, we have&nbsp;**revised**&nbsp;our School&nbsp;**Vision**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**Mission**&nbsp;as follows:

### Vision

A caring community of joyful learners and exemplary leaders.

### Mission

We strive to create a caring environment for all, ignite joy in lifelong learning and nurture leaders of character and intellect.

Our school motto of&nbsp;**“We Care**”, as well as our school values of T-EPIC (**T**eamwork,&nbsp;**P**erformance&nbsp;**E**xcellence,&nbsp;**I**ntegrity,&nbsp;**C**are), remain unchanged.
