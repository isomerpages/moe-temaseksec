<h3>2025 Principal's Message</h3>
<p>Look out for the new Principal's message in January 2025.</p>
<h3>2024 Principal's Message</h3>
<p>Since the start of 2023, after a process of engagement and re-envisioning,
we have&nbsp;<strong>revised</strong>&nbsp;our School&nbsp;<strong>Vision</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Mission</strong>,
and I am delighted to be able to share this with you:</p>
<h4>Vision</h4>
<p>A caring community of joyful learners and exemplary leaders.</p>
<h4>Mission</h4>
<p>We strive to create a caring environment for all, ignite joy in lifelong
learning and nurture leaders of character and intellect.</p>
<p>Our school motto of&nbsp;<strong>“We Care</strong>”, as well as our school
values of T-EPIC (<strong>T</strong>eamwork,&nbsp;<strong>P</strong>erformance&nbsp;<strong>E</strong>xcellence,&nbsp;<strong>I</strong>ntegrity,&nbsp;<strong>C</strong>are),
have remain unchanged.</p>
<h4>A CARING COMMUNITY</h4>
<p>The school motto of “We Care” resonated strongly across all groups we
engaged with, reflecting the longstanding identity and lived experiences
of the people in our community. Our teachers care deeply for the holistic
well-being of our students, we have a strong culture of peer support and
we are also blessed with caring stakeholders such as our parents and alumni.</p>
<p>We know that youths learn best in a safe and nurturing environment where
they feel cared for, supported and individually valued. In this environment,
they can explore their strengths and interests, learn socio-emotional skills,
experience challenges and cultivate a growth mindset. As we help them to
acquire good social skills and strong relationships, make repeated choices
that are consistent with the values they and their families hold dear,
as well as overcome failures and taste success, we also help them to build
a secure ego and a coherent sense of identity. With this, they are better
able to connect deeply with what most resonates with them and to find meaning
in their personal purpose.</p>
<p>Many of you have shared that&nbsp;<strong>the “ideal Temasekian” is one who embodies the value of care for those around them and possesses the willingness to serve the school, community and nation</strong>.
It is also my hope that our Temasekians will find their sense of identity
and purpose in serving the diverse needs of the community around them,
looking outward towards a life of commitment, sacrifice, responsibility
and contribution… to find that spot in their hearts where, in the words
of author and theologian Frederick Buechner, “One’s deep gladness meets
the world’s deep hunger”.</p>
<p>In fact, I see this care for the greater good as fundamental to the character
that we want to nurture in our young – character as a deeper moral quality
oriented around love, service/self-sacrifice, care and integrity, supplemented
by the secondary traits that help them to succeed (such as grit, productivity
and self-discipline).</p>
<p>This deep moral purpose then brings enduring hope and resilience – in
fact, having a strong sense of personal purpose is one of the key predictors
for resilience and success. This is the antidote to the directionlessness,
“FOMO” (fear of missing out) and fragility that we see in some of our young,
who have been affected by an increasingly postmodern, individualistic culture
that has lost its sense of universal truth and “telos”.</p>
<h4>JOY OF LEARNING</h4>
<p>The second key emphasis in our revised Vision and Mission is “joy of learning”.
The crux of the idea behind this is really for our students to experience
the joy of learning so that they love learning and will be motivated to
keep learning and growing throughout their lifetime.</p>
<p>When we conducted focus group discussions with the students, they described
the experiences that have led to joy of learning for them. These included:
gamification of learning, experiential and authentic hands-on activities,
learning journeys outside the classroom, collaborative learning with their
peers, technology-enabled lessons, bite-sized assessment to track progress,
humorous stories and jokes by teachers, as well as attractive rewards such
as candy and bubble tea. These are all positive and fun-filled experiences
that we wish to provide for our students (maybe except the candy and bubble
tea, which I would not recommend too much of!) With the restrictions imposed
due to COVID-19 receding into the background, we have made a concerted
effort to reintroduce some of these experiences for our students, including
authentic partnerships with community partners and also learning journeys
(both local and overseas).</p>
<p>Additionally, we want to teach our students the skills and dispositions
for learning – for them to understand how to learn well (individually and
with their peers), practice those skills, and be able to monitor their
own progress. Hence, our revised&nbsp;<strong>Learning Dispositions</strong>&nbsp;(LD)
will serve as the key vehicle for us to guide this process. The LD can
be summarised by the acronym&nbsp;<strong>GROWTH</strong>, which stands
for:&nbsp;<strong>G</strong>row with Others,&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>eflect
for Improvement,&nbsp;<strong>O</strong>vercome Challenges,&nbsp;<strong>W</strong>ork
towards Excellence,&nbsp;<strong>T</strong>ake Initiative and&nbsp;<strong>H</strong>eart
for Learning. We have been explicitly teaching these skills in the curriculum
and have set up an LD coaching system under which every student is assigned
a teacher as his/her “learning coach”, who meets him/her regularly to guide
the student along this journey of growth in their LD.</p>
<p>Joy of learning is really broader, and deeper than the ‘wish-list’ of
student experiences described above. Broader in the sense that this can
be experienced in everyday school life and not just during special programmes.
For instance, we see this happening daily through differentiated instruction
to meet varied interests, applied learning to solve real-world problems,
self-directed learning that is exploratory and empowering (for example
Student-Initiated learning on HBL days), learning that is personally motivated,
learning that allows students to have a sense of mastery (e.g. through
the use of self-assessment rubrics) – all facilitated within the context
of a creative and supportive environment in which it is safe to fail.</p>
<p>It is also deeper in the sense that we want students to experience deep
cognitive engagement/’flow’, which is a key (and enjoyable, even addictive)
part of learning. Engagement has also been proven to be one of the key
elements that contribute to well-being. This desire for flow is what drives
“<strong>H</strong>eart for Learning” (part of&nbsp;<strong>GROWTH</strong>).
I cannot put this better than what the novelist Daniel Keyes writes in
“Flowers for Algernon”: “I’m living at a peak of clarity and beauty I never
knew existed. Every part of me is attuned to the work. I soak it up into
my pores during the day, and at night—in the moments before I pass off
into sleep—ideas explode into my head like fireworks.&nbsp;<strong>There is no greater joy than the burst of solution to a problem</strong>.
Incredible that anything could happen to take away this bubbling energy,
the zest that fills everything I do. It’s as if all the knowledge I’ve
soaked in during the past months has coalesced and lifted me to a peak
of light and understanding. This is beauty, love, and truth all rolled
into one.&nbsp;<strong>This is joy</strong>.”</p>
<p>When we talk about love for lifelong learning and knowing how to learn,
the discourse is often about how it is a necessity in the VUCA (volatile,
uncertain, complex and ambiguous) job market today. Through our Education
and Career Guidance (ECG) efforts, we also try to expose our students to
various industries to guide them to make informed choices. But beyond surviving
and making a good living, this joy of learning is also linked to a much
deeper meaning and sense of fulfilment in our lives. This is because ultimately
any abiding commitment (be it a commitment to learning, a higher ideal
or a greater purpose) has to be driven by intense emotions and a sense
of wonderment. I know that my own schooling experience allowed me to catch
glimpses of this joy of learning that is difficult to describe adequately
in words, and it is the memory of such experiences and the desire to feel
that again that has driven me to continue to pursue learning (and to want
to create such experiences for our students!). If we can light that spark
in our students, there is no lack of resources out there for them to explore
and to learn on their own.</p>
<p>As we prepare our young for their future, Martin Luther King Jr’s words
come to my mind. He advised that that one’s work should have:</p>
<p>Length – something you can work at to get better at over a lifetime;</p>
<p>Breadth – it should touch many other people’s lives; &amp;</p>
<p>Height – it should put you in service to some ideal and satisfy the soul’s
yearning for beauty and righteousness.</p>
<p>This is a lofty but absolutely worthy ideal for all of us to work towards.</p>
<h4>EXEMPLARY LEADERSHIP</h4>
<p>In TMS, we have had a longstanding emphasis on leadership – this is seen
in our previous school vision, which is “A school known for nurturing leaders
of character and intellect”. We admit students via DSA(Leadership), and
almost half of our students hold leadership positions. All our students
learn about self-leadership, and our student leaders get to experience
a comprehensive and structured leadership development programme that allows
them to learn values and skills through mentoring and the provision of
ample school-based and external platforms and opportunities to live out
these values and skills. Many of our student leader alumni have reflected
that the TMS student leadership programme has taught them enduring values
and life skills, including service to others, vision and initiative, communication
and collaboration skills, resilience, resourcefulness and respect for diversity.
As a school leader, I can also see how school tone, school pride and school
affiliation have all been positively impacted by this emphasis on leadership.</p>
<p>Going forward, we wish to build upon this established programme that we
have created over the years, with additional emphasis on “exemplary” leaders.
In choosing this word “exemplary”, we hope to highlight the importance
of role-modelling. Aristotle said, “We are what we repeatedly do.” And
therefore, we become what we want to be by consistently being what we want
to become each day – in thought, word and deed. Our student leaders do
not just have to learn and apply knowledge and skills; they are held to
higher standards of living out the values that we have taught them.</p>
<p>We know that great leaders inspire unflagging loyalty and respect not
just by having a great vision, but by so fully embodying a system of values,
beliefs and behaviours (even at great personal price) that they build a
moral ecology around themselves – they create a culture that sets the unspoken
norms of thinking and behaviour, and in doing so transform a society for
the better. Singapore has benefitted from such leadership. Through our
student leadership programme, we hope to inspire and transform our students
with similar examples of moral greatness and servant leadership. As the
mathematician and philosopher Alfred North Whitehead said, “Moral education
is impossible without the habitual vision of greatness” – and it is this
habitual vision of the best that the human race has to offer that we want
to hold up for our future leaders to aspire towards.</p>
<h4>COMMON CURRICULUM</h4>
<p>For most of the secondary schools in Singapore, 2024 is the first year
of the G1/G2/G3 system, mixed form classes, and the dropping of stream
labels. For TMS, however, because we have had the privilege to pilot Full
SBB and the common curriculum from its inception, 2024 in fact marks the
fourth year of our journey!</p>
<p>In these more diverse form classes that we have had since 2021, we make
every effort to ensure that all students feel known, valued and respected,
and we continue to celebrate effort and progress as we differentiate and
personalise learning for each student, sometimes with the help of technology.
While students with a greater level of needs will receive the support that
they need to do their best, this does not come at the expense of the higher
progress students, who are still given the resources and opportunities
that they require to thrive and to excel. For instance, we have talent
development programmes such as the&nbsp;<strong>Temasek Ignis Programme (TIP)</strong>&nbsp;for
exposure to and deepening of interests and strengths.</p>
<p>We are glad to observe that the students have bonded very well together
and their learning experience has been greatly enriched.</p>
<p>As always, I welcome any ideas or areas of potential collaboration that
you might have for our school. Please do not hesitate to get in touch with
us. Have a fruitful and meaningful 2024!</p>
