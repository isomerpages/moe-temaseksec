Character and Citizenship Education (CCE), including National Education (NE), and Social and Emotional Learning (SEL), are integral to the holistic development of our students, leading to positive life outcomes. CCE 2022 provides an integrated approach to addressing our students’ development of values, character, social-emotional (SE) well-being, and citizenship dispositions in a coherent and holistic way.

  

CCE undergirds all that we do at TMS. CCE 2022 aims to develop in our students:

a. **Good character**: Have a sound moral compass, a strong sense of right and wrong, think critically and ethically, be discerning in judgment, take responsibility for choices and actions, be caring towards others and strive for excellence;

  

b. **Resilience and social-emotional well-being**: Have a balanced sense of self, form healthy relationships, be resilient when faced with challenges, find meaning in life, and have a sense of gratitude and appreciation;

  

c. **Active citizenship**: Develop a strong national identity based on a sense of belonging to the nation, a sense of hope in themselves and the future, an awareness of the reality of Singapore’s vulnerabilities and constraints, and the will to act on improving the lives of others, and building a future for our nation; and

  

d. **Future readiness**: Have a sense of purpose in life, develop the dispositions of adaptability and lifelong learning so as to be able to navigate education and career pathways purposefully and take on the challenges of the future, including the world of work.

### CCE FRAMEWORK

*   **School Values** – T●EPIC refers to the values of Teamwork, Excellence in Performance, Integrity and Care to be nurtured in every student.
    
      
    
*   **SE Competencies** enable students to manage self and relationships effectively, as well as make informed, responsible decisions. **Civic Literacy** and **Cross-Cultural Skills** enable students to adapt to a complex and culturally diverse world.
    
      
    
*   **Awareness, Choice, Action** and **Introspection** are key stages of learning that support the development of character and citizenship dispositions, including a sense of belonging, hope and reality, and the will to act for the good of the society.
    
      
    
*   **The Temasek Creed** exemplifies the desired student outcomes, where every student is nurtured to be citizens of character; one who is exemplary in conduct, passionate in seeking knowledge, undaunted in, and in so doing, may better serve their family, their school and their nation.

## CCE CURRICULUM


Every student is explicitly taught skills and knowledge through the (ALIVE!) (**A**ctive **L**earning **I**n **V**alues **E**ducation!) and FACETime (**F**orm teacher **A**LIVE! C**CE**) programmes.



**Contemporary Issues (CI)**


Since 2017, to help raise students’ awareness of local, regional and global issues, we started to focus on having discussions of CI (e.g. whether Ben Davis should have been granted NS Deferment, issues relating to race, inequality, online falsehoods etc.). Through a whole-school approach, students discuss these issues through role-plays, activities and simulation exercises during ALIVE!, FACETime and also reflect on the current affairs articles. These platforms are help students to explore multiple perspectives and in so doing give agency to students to become citizens who can act for the good of society.

### CYBER WELLNESS (CW) AND MENTAL HEALTH (MH)


Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are becoming increasingly pervasive in our world. While creating instant connectivity and access to vast repositories of information, knowledge, and opinions, the open nature of the Internet can expose our students to undesirable content and influences. CW in CCE is important as it focuses on the well-being of our students as they navigate cyberspace, equipping them with the knowledge and skills to harness the power of ICT for positive purposes, maintain a positive presence in cyberspace, and be safe and responsible users of ICT.

MH is about having a balance in various aspects of life, and learning values and social-emotional competencies to cope with life’s situations, relate to others and contribute to the community. A focus on MH in CCE at the secondary level helps students to strengthen their resilience and wellbeing; differentiate between stress, distress (overwhelming stress), and illness; enhance help-seeking efficacy; as well as destigmatise mental illness.

  

**jOURney** is an online publication by TMS CCE Committee. It aims to provide parents with up-to-date information and practical tips to support your child's growth. jOURney emphasises that your child's road to success is in OUR hands! Through a joint effort, we hope to support each child's aspirations and help them to build their identity. In each issue, the three main themes of MH, CW and CI will be covered.

  

We trust the resources in each theme will help you to understand, engage and support your child better. In doing so, we hope your child will be able to make informed choices, form positive relationships and develop awareness and agency toward issues in the local, regional and global fronts.

### EDUCATION AND CAREER GUIDANCE (ECG)


Students today face a future that will be very different from that experienced by their parents and teachers. ECG is about equipping students with the necessary knowledge, skills, and values to make informed decisions at each key education stage for successful transition from school to further education or work, and hence to manage their career pathways and lifelong learning throughout their lives. Through ECG, students explore their strengths and abilities, examine their life’s purpose, and develop qualities of proactivity, adaptability, and resilience to prepare themselves for the 21st Century.

  

One of the highlights of TMS’ ECG programme is the annual Career Guidance Day (CGD). CGD 2021 was held on 1 April 2021, and included sharing sessions by representatives from Junior Colleges, Polytechnics and ITE. Career professionals in a variety of fields were also invited to share their experiences with Secondary 4 and 5 students.

We welcome our ECG counsellor, Ms Siti.

## SEXUALITY EDUCATION


In this current age, better nutrition and improved health care has resulted in children reaching puberty and sexual maturity at a younger age. Furthermore, our students are also exposed to a wide range of influences from the media, including sexual mores that could endanger health and undermine the integrity of the family. Our students require guidance so that they can respond with discernment to the sexual messages in the media and other sources. Sexuality Education enables our students to understand the physiological, social, and emotional changes they experience as they mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships including those with members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible decisions on sexuality matters. While parents play the primary role in the sexuality education of their children, especially in the teaching and transmission of values about sex and sexuality, schools play an important supportive role.
