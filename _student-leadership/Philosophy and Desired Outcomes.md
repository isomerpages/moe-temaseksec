The philosophy of LEAD@TMS is founded on the belief that the secondary school years are invaluable to developing character and values in students. To do so, student leadership development is a purposeful platform to harness youth potential as secondary school students are able to explore and grasp more complex concepts and issues related to school and community.

  

The schoolâ€™s Desired Outcomes are framed by the Temasek Creed, which carries the qualities that we purpose to develop in Temasekians.

  

To this end, LEAD@TMS is designed to anchor students on a core set of school values, T-EPIC (Teamwork, Performance Excellence, Integrity, Care). The focus is on developing social and emotional competencies which would enable them to lead by caring for others, pursue excellence, build positive relationships and make responsible decisions. This is folded into the larger narrative of preparing students to be responsible citizens who would contribute positively to society in the future.
