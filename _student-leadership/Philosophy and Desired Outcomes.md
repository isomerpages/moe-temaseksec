<p>The philosophy of LEAD@TMS is founded on the belief that the secondary
school years are invaluable to developing character and values in students.
To do so, student leadership development is a purposeful platform to harness
youth potential as secondary school students are able to explore and grasp
more complex concepts and issues related to school and community.</p>

<p>The school’s Desired Outcomes are framed by the Temasek Creed, which carries
the qualities that we purpose to develop in Temasekians.</p>
<p>To this end, LEAD@TMS is designed to anchor students on a core set of
school values, T-EPIC (Teamwork, Performance Excellence, Integrity, Care).
The focus is on developing social and emotional competencies which would
enable them to lead by caring for others, pursue excellence, build positive
relationships and make responsible decisions. This is folded into the larger
narrative of preparing students to be responsible citizens who would contribute
positively to society in the future.</p>
