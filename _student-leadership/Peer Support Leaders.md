<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>To promote character education and peer support</p>
<h3>About</h3>
<p>All student leaders are trained and play the role of being a peer supporter
in the school, but the Peer Support Leaders provide the training for all
students to be a peer supporter as well. Apart from running events that
help build the character and heartware, they also run key events like the
Temasek Charity Challenge which helps students appreciate the challenges
of fund raising, helping all Temasekians develop the value of empathy.</p>
<p>The Peer Support Leaders also run the Green Scavenger Race (environmental
clean-up VIA) as well as the Young Leaders Camp, an outreach programme
for primary schools since 2003.</p>
