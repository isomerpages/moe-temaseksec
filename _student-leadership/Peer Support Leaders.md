### Mission

To promote character education and peer support

### About

All student leaders are trained and play the role of being a peer supporter in the school, but the Peer Support Leaders provide the training for all students to be a peer supporter as well. Apart from running events that help build the character and heartware, they also run key events like the Temasek Charity Challenge which helps students appreciate the challenges of fund raising, helping all Temasekians develop the value of empathy.

The Peer Support Leaders also run the Green Scavenger Race (environmental clean-up VIA) as well as the Young Leaders Camp, an outreach programme for primary schools since 2003.
