<h3>Mission</h3>

<h3>About</h3>
<p>The Student Councillors are the cornerstone of leadership in all schools.
Apart from being an essential role where they take the lead in key ceremonies
like the Morning Assembly and the Sec 1 Investiture, the Student Councillors
also run the Graduation Night, a capstone event for all Temasekians before
they graduate from the school. The Student Councillors run All Staff Day
(or what 's commonly known as Teachers Day), an event that helps students
appreciate the teachers and staff that have made a difference in their
lives.</p>
<p>The Student Councillors hold the distinction of being the first leadership
group that is formed in the school.</p>
