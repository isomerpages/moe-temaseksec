### Mission

To promote sports, health and fitness

### About

The Sports Captains promote health and sports in the school. Contrary to the name, Sports Captains are not captains of the sports CCAs, but are champions who promote health and sports in the school to all Temasekians! They run sporting events such as the Sports Challenge, an inter-class games competition during the End-Of-Semester activities as well as the Temasek Cup, a highly competitive sports competition in areas such as football. The Sports Captains also promote good health by running workshops such as Mental Wellness and the Smoking Cessation Programme.
