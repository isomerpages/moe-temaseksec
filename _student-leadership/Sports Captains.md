<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>To promote sports, health and fitness</p>
<h3>About</h3>
<p>The Sports Captains promote health and sports in the school. Contrary
to the name, Sports Captains are not captains of the sports CCAs, but are
champions who promote health and sports in the school to all Temasekians!
They run sporting events such as the Sports Challenge, an inter-class games
competition during the End-Of-Semester activities as well as the Temasek
Cup, a highly competitive sports competition in areas such as football.
The Sports Captains also promote good health by running workshops such
as Mental Wellness and the Smoking Cessation Programme.</p>
