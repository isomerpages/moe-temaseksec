### Mission

To promote citizenry and National Education

### About

The Young Ambassadors are essential to helping students understand the importance of being united as one community in Singapore. During the many National Education events, the Young Ambassadors conduct assembly programmes, lessons and activities to highlight what it means to live and thrive in Singapore. They also help Temasekians understand and appreciate Singapore's heritage as well as the rites of passage as we grow into contributing members of society in Singapore.
 

The latest programme the Young Ambassadors run is the Fort Siloso Trail, an outreach programme to help young residents understand the challenges of Singapore's 20th century's beginnings.
