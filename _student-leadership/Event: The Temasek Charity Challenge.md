Every year, the student leaders organise the Temasek Charity Challenge, an event to raise funds for the President's Challenge.  

The challenge consists of two parts. The Sec 1-2s run a the GoMAD Carnival in school while the Sec 3-5s go to the streets to fund-raise!

Over the years, the TCC has raised more than $500k for the President's Challenge!

This culminates in a Record-Making Event in the Singapore Book of Records to celebrate the fund-raising efforts of the students!  

This has been a tradition since 2006!
