Every year, the student leaders organise the Temasek Charity Challenge, an event to raise funds for the President's Challenge.  

This culminates in a Record-Making Event in the Singapore Book of Records to celebrate the fund-raising efforts of the students!  

This has been a tradition since 2006!
