Every year, the students and student leaders organise the Temasek Charity Challenge, an event to raise funds for the President's Challenge.  

TCC has two parts: the street fund-raising is done by the Sec 3-5s whilst the GoMAD Carnival is done by the Sec 1-2s in the school!

Over the years, the school has raised more than $500k for the President's Challenge!

This culminates in a Record-Making Event in the Singapore Book of Records to celebrate the fund-raising efforts of the students!  

This has been a tradition since 2006!
