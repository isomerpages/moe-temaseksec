These leadership opportunities can be broadly categorised into different tiers.

<img style="width:60%" src="/images/Levels.png">

**Situational Leaders**&nbsp;are appointed to exercise leadership at the class level. These include leaders who are appointed by the class (e.g. subject representatives, VIA Leaders) or students who want to lead in their own projects (e.g. LEAD Character Leaders). They could also exercise their leadership skills through participation in competitions, project work and group work, which are regular features in the classroom. Students are encouraged to present their ideas to their teachers and peers to build confidence as well as to hone their oratorical skills.  
  
**Student leaders**&nbsp;are elected into a leadership position. These include CCA leaders as well as leaders from the five leadership groups.  
  
**CCA Leaders**&nbsp;can be found in all CCA groups,from the Uniformed Groups to the Clubs, Societies and Aesthetic Groups. They include positions such as officers, executive committee members and sectional leaders. Their key role is to manage administrative duties of the CCA, build camaraderie amongst their members, and motivate them to performance excellence.  
  
The five Leadership Groups provide more than 45% of the student population with positional leadership opportunities to serve the school and the wider community. Each leadership group is unique and has a tremendous impact on how students contribute to their peers and the community.  
  
The&nbsp;**Executive Committee**&nbsp;consists of the exco members of the five leadership groups. They have higher levels of responsibilities and are in charge of key events and activities in the school.  
  
The&nbsp;**Student Rep Committee**&nbsp;consists of the Chairpersons and Vice-Chairpersons of the five leadership groups. The committee provides input for the overall running of the school with regards to school safety, school improvement and general direction of the student leadership groups.
