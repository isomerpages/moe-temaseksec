### Mission

To foster class spirit, and promote school and class welfare

### About

No class can function well without the support of the Class Managers. The Class Managers promote class and school welfare and camaraderie by organising class bonding activities as well as guiding their peers to plan VIA projects that bring people together. They also organise Gratitude Week, an event that helps students appreciate people who have made a difference in their lives, like parents and teachers.

An outreach they organise is Your Next Leadership Journey, an event that helps primary school students learn more about secondary school life!
