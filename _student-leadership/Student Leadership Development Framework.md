LEAD@TMS is guided by the Student Leadership Development Framework that helps the Student Leadership Committee to bear in mind key pillars that would shape the way we plan and enable student leadership development.

School Values of T-EPIC refer to the values of Teamwork, Excellence in Performance, Integrity and Care to be nurtured in every student.  
  
Leadership Skills and Knowledge are taught to equip students to meet the needs of the core areas of Service to the Community and Service to School (Support, Character, Health, Welfare and Citizenry).  
  
Student leaders go through the key stages of Learning of Values and Attitudes, Skills and Knowledge, Opportunities for Application, Reflection, and Mentoring by Seniors and Teachers.  
  
The Temasek Creed exemplifies the desired student outcomes, where every student is nurtured to be citizens of character; one who is exemplary in conduct, passionate in seeking knowledge, undaunted in spirit, and in so doing, may better serve their family, their school and their nation.
