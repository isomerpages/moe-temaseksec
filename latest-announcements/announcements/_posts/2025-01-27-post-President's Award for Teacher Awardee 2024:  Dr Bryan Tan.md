<p>With a PhD in Organic Chemistry, Dr Bryan Tan could have gone on to teach
in a university. Instead, he chose to give back to his alma mater, Temasek
Secondary School. He had been inspired by his own teachers, who had helped
him out of a rocky start in life.</p>
<p>At school, Dr Tan puts on two distinct hats – one that nurtures the professional
development of his colleagues, and another that sparks his students’ interest
in science.</p>
