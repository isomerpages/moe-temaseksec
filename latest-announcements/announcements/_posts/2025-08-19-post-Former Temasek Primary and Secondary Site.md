<p>The former Temasek Primary and Secondary site at New Upper Changi Road/
Bedok South Road is earmarked for future housing development and there
are plans to demolish the school buildings around 2Q2026 (tentative).</p>
<p>MOE has been working with relevant agencies to explore the possibility
of a visit to the former school site before its demolition. After further
study, the assessment is that the state of the buildings at the former
school site is not suitable for a visit.</p>
