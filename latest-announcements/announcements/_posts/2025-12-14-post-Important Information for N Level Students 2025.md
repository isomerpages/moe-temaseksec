<h2>Information on N Level Results Collection</h2>
<p>Dear Temasekians and Parents/Guardians of the 2025 Graduating Cohort,</p>
<p>MOE and SEAB have recently announced that the GCE N-Level Examination
results will be released on&nbsp;Thursday, 18 December 2025 at 2pm. Temasekians
who are reporting to school for the collection of their N Level results
are to report to the school hall by 1.30 pm and parents/guardians are welcome
to join us.</p>
<p>Temasekians are reminded to be properly groomed and dressed in their school
attire. Those who are not dressed in accordance with our attire and grooming
standards will not be allowed to enter the school hall for the release
of results.</p>
<p>Temasekians who are unable to collect their results in person should inform
the school before 18 Dec 2025 through their Form Teacher and can appoint
a proxy to collect a physical copy of their results on their behalf. Proxies
can collect the results at the General Office from 3pm onwards.&nbsp; Proxies
are required to produce the relevant documents (Photo ID for identification
&amp;amp; Letter of Authorisation) for the school’s verification when collecting
the results. Temasekians may contact the school through their Form Teacher
for assistance if they are unable to appoint a proxy. Please do so before
18 Dec 2025.</p>
