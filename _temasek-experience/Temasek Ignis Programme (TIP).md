<p>From playing with a fiery ball of ideas and thoughts as a young cub, the
mature lion begins to resolutely explore and keep the fire burning. In
the end, you become the lion that walks through fire, ready to serve, lead
and take control of the flames of glory.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Temasek&nbsp;<em>Ignis</em>&nbsp;Programme</strong>&nbsp;is
the school's signature programme meant for stretching students with talents
in both intellect and character, and for increasing their capacity in these
areas. Students are stretched in three key domains: academic related skills,
enriched academic content, and leadership related skills. By developing
students in these domains, they are ready to take up greater opportunities
as well as to serve others.</p>
