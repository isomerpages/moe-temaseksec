<h2>HISTORY</h2>
<p>The Temasek Track &amp; Field team was established in 1984. Our 50 member
strong Track &amp; Field team has a multi-disciplinary culture that is
open to developing sporting talents from both within the Track &amp; Field
team and also from other CCAs in Temasek.</p>

challenges with determination and strives for performance excellence.</p>
<h2>TRAINING</h2>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p>Training is held twice a week in school and at various external venues
such as Bedok Reservoir Park, MacRitchie Reservoir Park and Bedok Stadium
to expose members to different running conditions.</p>
<p>Members go through a progressive and systematic training plan. Starting
from developing a strong core strength affecting posture, balance and coordination,
members then get to specialise in sprints, middle and/or long distance
jumps and/or throws.</p>
<p>The team trains for both individual events like the 200m, 800m and 1500m
and team events like the 4 x 100m relay race.</p>
