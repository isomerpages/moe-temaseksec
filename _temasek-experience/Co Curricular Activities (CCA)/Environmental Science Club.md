<h2>HISTORY</h2>
<p>The Environmental Science Club was first established in 2016, formerly
known as The Green Club. Our CCA brings together like-minded students who
want to do their part for environmental conservation and at the same time
learn more about environmental issues, including climate change, biodiversity
and much more.</p>

<h2>MISSION</h2>
<p>The Environmental Science Club aspires to tackle the challenges of climate
change through creating awareness and personal responsibility within our
school and community. The members all uphold a common goal to develop environmentally-friendly
habits which translate into lifelong actions that seek to make our world
a better place.&nbsp;Our CCA also aims to learn more about biodiversity
and strives to become people truly living in harmony with nature.</p>

<h2>TRAINING</h2>
<p>Training is held twice a week in school. Students engage in activities
that build their awareness of environmental sustainability. Students also
learn how to prepare and conduct sharings on the spreading of environmental
messages. Last but not least, students will also have hands-on opportunities
to learn how to grow vegetables in an urban setting.</p>
