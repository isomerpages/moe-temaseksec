<p>Life is full of possibilities. In Temasek, a student’s potential is only
limited by their imagination. Our Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) programmes
are full and varied, and students are well-known for the breadth and depth
of their interests, which we support whole-heartedly and thoroughly.</p>
<p>Temasekians are truly keen on their many interests—be it Uniformed Groups,
Sports, Performing Arts, or Clubs. Whichever CCA they are in, nurturing
a sense of commitment and dedication to their craft is the culture here,
and we want to also spark the passion towards activities the students engage
in.</p>
<p>Every Temasekian – ‘A citizen of character who seeks performance excellence
in all that he does and is open to new learning and possibilities.’</p>
<p>At Temasek Secondary School, students’ CCA experiences form a cornerstone
of their holistic education for the 21st century. Co-Curricular Activities
(CCAs) have been an integral part of our Singapore education landscape
in recognition of the fact that good academic performance alone is an insufficient
gauge of student quality. The rapid advancement of technological innovations,
global competition, and a push towards a knowledge-based economy require
that our students learn to have a repertoire of soft and hard skills to
enable them to succeed in a future economy that is still in the making.
Our students are expected to develop a high Emotional Quotient to succeed
in diverse work environments. At the same time, they can exhibit soft skills
like creativity, leadership abilities, teamwork, flexibility, communication
skills, resilience and an enterprising spirit that will enable them to
stay relevant for the future.</p>
<p>Therefore, the emphasis should not only be placed on the pursuit of academic
excellence but also in the pursuit of meaningful opportunities and possibilities
afforded through CCAs. CCAs become a platform in which a myriad of activities
provide many teachable moments for students at Temasek to develop and practise
crucial 21st century skills to create and secure lifelong success both
as individuals and team players.</p>
<p>Below are all the CCAs offered in Temasek Secondary School:</p>

<p>All Temasekians are required to take up a CCA from one of the core CCAs
offered in Temasek. In Secondary One, students will be allocated a CCA
based on one of five choices that the students have selected and they are
expected to remain in that CCA for the duration of their secondary school
years unless they have medical reasons that preclude them from serving
their commitments to the CCA.</p>
<p>Students are reminded to make their choices wisely as they may not be
allotted CCA of their first choice in cases where the CCA is oversubscribed
and they may be allotted choices other than their 1st choice.</p>
<p><sup>+</sup>Shooting, Choir, Drama, Modern Dance are CCAs that offer DSA.
<br>**Pop Acappella is both a core CCA and an interest group.</p>
