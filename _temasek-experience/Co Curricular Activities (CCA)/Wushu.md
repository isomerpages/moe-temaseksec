<h2>HISTORY</h2>

</div>
<p>The Temasek Wushu Team was set up in 2002 and its membership has grown
to the present strength of approximately 40 members. As the only martial
arts CCA in Temasek, its members are in demand for their ability to showcase
performances that exhibit speed, strength and flexibility. The members
are also exposed to theatrical performance to develop their showmanship.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>MISSION</h2>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="ws.jpg" src="/images/ws.jpg">
</div>
<p>Wushu aspires to develop martial arts skills in its members through a
blend of performance and finesse. Through this, we aim to develop them
into confident, disciplined and competent practitioners of Wushu who can
display flexibility and strength in their movement through flawless execution.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>TRAINING</h2>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

<p>Training is held twice a week in school. Through systematic strength and
flexibility training, students are taught basic Wushu skills in Chang Quan
or Nan Quan before moving on to more advanced weapons training such as
the International Sword, Broadsword, Spear, and Cudgel routine.&nbsp;</p>
