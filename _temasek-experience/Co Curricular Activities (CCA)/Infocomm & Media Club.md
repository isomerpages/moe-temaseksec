<h2>HISTORY</h2>
<p>The Infocomm Media Club started with the merger of the 'Audio-Visual (AV)
Club' and the 'Photography Club' to provide students with a more holistic
experience. Students provide support for school events which allow them
to pursue their interests in the areas of audio-visual technology, photography
and more recently, videography. Currently, the club has approximately 60
members.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>MISSION</h2>
<p>The Infocomm Media Club aims to develop in our students the skills of
communicating effectively, making critical observations, and having a keen
eye for detail. These are skills that are crucial for managing the technical
support for an event and taking purposeful photographs and videos.</p>
