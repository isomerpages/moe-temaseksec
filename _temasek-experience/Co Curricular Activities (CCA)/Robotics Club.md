<h2>HISTORY</h2>
<p>The Robotics Club first started in 2007 as the Mathematics Club. In 2015,
the club was renamed as the Robotics Club in recognition of the shift towards
enabling our students to be future ready. The club was revamped as a specialised
CCA providing opportunities to train students in four specific disciplines
– Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) – through an
interdisciplinary and applied approach using Robotics programming and construction
as a platform. Currently, the robotics club has approximately 30 members.</p>
