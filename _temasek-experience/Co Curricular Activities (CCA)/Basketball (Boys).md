<h2>MISSION</h2>
<p>Basketball aspires to provide its&nbsp;players&nbsp;with the&nbsp;opportunity
to&nbsp;learn the fundamental&nbsp;skills of&nbsp;basketball&nbsp;while
instilling life-lessons and values such as character, team work, discipline,
respect and sportsmanship.</p>
<h2>TRAINING</h2>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p>Training is held twice a week in school. The training programme is holistic
in approach, focusing on two aspects.</p>
<p>The first aspect is developing physical fitness such as timing, coordination,
speed, strength, and stamina with an emphasis on ball handling skills of
dribbling, passing and shooting. The second aspect seeks to maintain an
athlete’s well-being with sessions on nutrition and injury management.
Members also learn technical aspects in basketball refereeing to enhance
their game knowledge.</p>
