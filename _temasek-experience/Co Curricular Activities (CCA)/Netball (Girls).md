<h2>HISTORY</h2>
<p>The Netball team has had a long tradition in Temasek since the early days
of the school’s establishment. Being the only all-female CCA with a current
membership of over 40 members, it has evolved into a tenacious team that
seeks to instil a lifelong passion for Netball.</p>

<br>Training is held twice a week in school. The training programme comprises
progressive phases that focus on physical conditioning, speed and agility
training. Members learn tactical drills in defence and offence to be deployed
in matches. Developing mastery in ball handling such as passing accuracy
and shooting as well as footwork such as keeping control while pivoting
are some aspects of training.</p>
