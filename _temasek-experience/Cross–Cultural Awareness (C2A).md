<h4>WHY CROSS-CULTURAL AWARENESS (C2A)</h4>
<p>In preparing students for life, the school recognises the need for students
to be equipped with cross-cultural skills and global awareness so as to
navigate an increasingly diverse and complex world.</p>
<h4>OUTCOMES OF C2A</h4>
<p>The C2A curriculum allows students to engage in an interdisciplinary study
of topics related to culture, race, religion, ethnicity, gender, history
and heritage and globalisation within Singapore and our region.</p>
<p>In particular, the curriculum seeks to develop the following outcomes:</p>

<h4>STAGES OF LEARNING</h4>
<p>The key underlying principle of C2A is knowledge construction, sharing
and application within a social constructivist paradigm. Under this paradigm,
students develop the necessary attitudes, skills and knowledge through
3 stages of learning.</p>

<h4>PROJECT CULTURE</h4>
<p>Project Culture is a customised school-based curriculum to enhance Secondary
1 students' cross-cultural awareness. Students learn basic concepts of
culture, including cultural systems and values, in addition to developing
other 21st Century Competencies such as communication, collaboration and
information skills.
<br>
<br>In groups, students then make use of the learned knowledge and skills
to understand a "new" culture i.e. a particular nationality residing in
Singapore and comparing it with the existing Singapore culture.
<br>
<br>The learning culminates into an oral presentation.</p>

<h4>CAMP CULTURE</h4>
<p>Camp Culture caters to Secondary 2 students.
<br>
<br>This non-residential camp enhances students' learning through exposure
to various religious systems in Singapore. After the visits, students participate
in facilitated discussions, which allow them to share and connect their
learning from the different sites. Students also reflect on their attitudes
towards the different cultures.
<br>
<br>In 2018, Camp Culture evolved to enhance students' understanding and appreciation
of the Singapore Story and also the significance of our multiculturalism
and heritage through a customised learning experience.
<br>
<br>This experience helps students to develop the knowledge, skills and motivation
to adapt effectively in cross-cultural environments.</p>
