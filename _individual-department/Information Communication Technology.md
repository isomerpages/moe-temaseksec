The CPA syllabus emphasises on current technological developments and trends, and core computer skills, including coding. It is designed for students who are mainly visual learners and who are best engaged through hands-on learning activities. It provides opportunities for students to appreciate the applications of computer technology and the use of various software application packages to perform meaningful tasks. It seeks to nurture the students as effective and efficient end-users of such technology, through the mastery of core skills and to develop their confidence in learning new skills.

Students will be technologically adept as effective citizens and able to function and contribute effectively in a technologically-driven world.
