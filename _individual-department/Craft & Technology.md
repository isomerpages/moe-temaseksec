The Craft & Technology Department's aim is to develop an environment and curriculum that nurture students to think creatively, innovate and be responsible members of society. Through this, we hope our students become independent thinkers who are activists of innovation, and who have a genuine love for aesthetics and gracious living.  
  
## Design & Technology (D&T)

The Lower Secondary curriculum provides our students the opportunity to develop freehand sketching skills through idea generation and development. It also offers tactile learning experiences for students to construct prototypes of their chosen idea.  
  
At the Upper Secondary levels, designing and making are dealt with at a greater depth and scope. Through open-ended problem-based projects, students will get an opportunity to experience the five design phases of the design process as well as learn a repertoire of practical processes in the workshop. They will also gain a sound working knowledge of the various technology areas.  
  

Students will:

• Acquire visual-spatial skills through sketching, experimenting and prototyping

• Develop an appreciation for function, aesthetics & technology

• Build confidence, pride and tenacity through exploring real world design opportunities

• Use appropriate materials and tools to experiment and prototype ideas

  
## Art

In Lower Secondary, students are taught digital software skills as well as conventional dry and wet media such as colour pencils and poster colours. Students also learn the works of various artists including their intent and adapt the artists' style into their own artworks.

  

As they progress to Upper Secondary, students will have a greater opportunity to explore, experiment and apply various art media such as pen rendering acrylic paint and water colour. They will work with more varying themes, and learn various craft types, such as silk-painting, print-making and paper cutting.

  

Students will develop:

• Careful observation skills for still life images

• Confidence in drawing, colouring and painting

• Communication skills on the appropriate use of art terminology when viewing art works

• An understanding of elements of art and principles of design

  

## Nutrition & Food Science 

In the Lower Secondary Food and Consumer Education (FCE) programme, students get an opportunity to have a hands-on experience of tasting, seeing and learning about healthy food choices. They will carry out a thematic coursework where they plan a nutritious meal, cook and present it. They then do a reflection on their learning processes. They will carry out ICT collaboration to discuss and make recommendations when buying food products, and explore ways to prevent diet-related diseases. 

  

As they progress to Upper Secondary, students will be exposed to a wider range of methods used during preparation and cooking of an array of dishes. Coursework and experimental food are also key features of the subject.

  

\*_Nutrition and Food Science is also offered at GCE N(T) and GCE N(A) level._ 

  

Students will become consumers who are:

• Able to understand the importance of nutrition for long-term health

• Informed and able to make wise and ethical food choices

• Able to understand that consumers shape the world with their choices

  
## Music

The Lower Secondary curriculum comprises musical activities that will develop students’ instrumental and piano keyboard playing skills. In addition, students are also exposed to technological skills in midi sequencing and song arrangement. Students' understanding of the elements of music is deepened as they will be taught on how music can be utilised to create different musical styles. These activities involve listening, appreciating and discussing music from various cultures and styles, analysing and evaluating performances through multi-media modes.

  

At Upper Secondary, students will be exposed to a wider variety of music genres. They will go in depth into the understanding of musical elements and concepts, developing a greater range of skills in the use of music technology.

  

\*_Music is only offered at GCE N(T) Level._

  

Students  will be able to:

• Be literate in musical notations

• Perform simple songs on the digital piano keyboard and classroom percussion instruments

• Compose/arrange short excerpts of music for at least three parts (melody, chords and rhythm) 

• Collaborate and create a small ensemble performance of at least three parts based on a certain theme or self-composed lyrics

• Critique peers’ performances and show critical thinking in their feedback to peers
