<p>The Mathematics Department aims to develop students who are confident
and self-directed problem solvers. Our curriculum seeks to engage students
in varied learning experiences that deepen their understanding of concepts
and skills, strengthen their reasoning and communication skills, and empower
them with the disposition to use mathematics to solve problems, including
those in real world contexts.</p>
<h2>Lower Secondary</h2>
<h4>Mathematics is Everywhere – Making sense of data</h4>
<p>Numbers and graphs are used to give voice to the truth behind data. Constructing
a statistical poster is a powerful way to learn how to analyse data and
draw conclusions from the data.&nbsp;Students work in groups to collect,
classify and tabulate data on a topic of inquiry. As students tell the
story through statistical posters, they exercise and develop their quantitative
and communication skills.</p>
<p>Students learn to:
<br>•&nbsp; Apply statistics concepts to summarise and make sense of data
<br>•&nbsp; Solve problems based on real-world contexts
<br>•&nbsp; Use ICT tools to organise, interpret, analyse and present data
and information</p>
<h4>Mathematics is Everywhere - The Escape Room</h4>
<p>The Escape Room is a 60-minute game whereby the students work in groups
to solve Math puzzles by making sense of thought-provoking clues to escape
from a locked room. Through participating in this fun-filled game with
their peers, students get to apply the mathematics they have learned in
lower secondary mathematics and appreciate that mathematics is indeed everywhere!</p>
<p>Students learn to:
<br>•&nbsp; Apply mathematical concepts to solve mathematics puzzles
<br>• &nbsp;Work effectively as a team to interpret and make sense of the
thought-provoking clues provided
<br>•&nbsp; Use relevant ICT tools/devices to help unravel the clues in solving
the puzzles</p>
<h2>Upper Secondary</h2>
<h4>Seeing the World Through Mathematical Eyes – Mathematical Modelling</h4>
<p>Applying mathematics to real-world problems often involves modelling,
where reasonable assumptions and simplifications are made.&nbsp;Working
in groups, students apply mathematics to real-world problems by formulating
appropriate mathematical models to represent them, interpret and evaluate
the mathematical solutions in the context of problem and reflecting on
alternative model or solution.</p>
<p>Students will learn to:
<br>•&nbsp; Apply relevant mathematics to solve real-world problems
<br>•&nbsp; Think inventively and work collaboratively with others
<br>•&nbsp; Use relevant ICT tools/devices to interpret information and evaluate
solutions
<br>•&nbsp; Appreciate local or global issues around them</p>
