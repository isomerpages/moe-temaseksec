<p>The Mother Tongue Department's (Chinese Language, Malay Language and Tamil
Language) focus is to inspire students to develop a love for the various
mother tongue languages and cultures in a nurturing environment, so as
to develop students to be confident users of the languages. With the changing
multi-cultural and multi-lingual landscape in Singapore, we also hope to
raise students' linguistic abilities by focusing on students' reading,
writing, speaking and listening skills, and ensuring that all students
have the opportunity to express themselves and apply the skills that they
have learnt to authentic contexts purposely and meaningfully. We also seek
to raise students' cultural awareness through various cultural programmes
and activities, so that they can learn to embrace and appreciate their
own and other cultures.</p>
<p>As a Department, we offer Higher Mother Tongue Languages (Chinese, Malay,
Tamil). We aim to develop higher level of proficiency, a deeper appreciation,
and love for the languages, literature and culture on the students.</p>
<h2>All Levels</h2>
<h4>Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) Reading Programme</h4>
<p>This programme aims to instill an interest for reading MTL short stories,
thus helping students to appreciate the author's use of language. Each
story bears different themes and characterisation. The varied activities
conducted by teachers help make this programme engaging for students.</p>
<p>In addition to reading the stipulated literary works recommended by teachers,
students also participate in the school's Annual Reading Superstar Competition
where they collaborate to create videos or podcasts that capture their
reflections on the texts that they have read. Selected students also attend
reading-related activities and literary seminars, such as the Mother Tongue
Fortnight events organised in school or other similar events held in other
schools and at the language centre.</p>
<p>Students will:
<br>•&nbsp; Gain interest in reading and broaden their exposure to different
text types&nbsp;
<br>•&nbsp; Develop critical thinking skills as they reflect on their reading
of various works
<br>•&nbsp; Be more confident and effective communicators as they create videos/podcasts
to present their reflections
<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp;Appreciate and understand the author's craft and creativity
in conveying meaning so that they can sharpen their own skills in reading
and writing</p>
<h2>Secondary One to Three</h2>
<h4>Mother Tongue Fortnight Programme</h4>
<p>Students are immersed in various cultural and literary activities during
the Mother Tongue Fortnight.</p>
<p>The activities in this programme are varied and cater to students of different
levels. The activities also involve mass participation to allow every student
to enjoy, appreciate and understand the language and culture.</p>
<p>Students will:
<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp;Widen their knowledge and appreciation of their MTL and culture
through various hands on activities
<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp;Extend their learning and understanding of their MTL beyond
the classroom
<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp;Enjoy and express their creativity through various oratorical
and singing competitions</p>
