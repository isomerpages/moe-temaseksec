The Mother Tongue Department's (Chinese Language, Malay Language and Tamil Language) focus is to inspire students to develop a love for the various mother tongue languages and cultures in a nurturing environment, so as to develop students to be confident users of the languages. With the changing multi-cultural and multi-lingual landscape in Singapore, we also hope to raise students' linguistic abilities by focusing on students' reading, writing, speaking and listening skills, and ensuring that all students have the opportunity to express themselves and apply the skills that they have learnt to authentic contexts purposely and meaningfully. We also seek to raise students' cultural awareness through various cultural programmes and activities, so that they can learn to embrace and appreciate their own and other cultures.

As a Department, we offer Higher Mother Tongue Languages (Chinese, Malay, Tamil). We aim to develop higher level of proficiency, a deeper appreciation, and love for the languages, literature and culture on the students. 

## All Levels  

#### Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) Reading Programme

This programme aims to instill an interest for reading MTL short stories, thus helping students to appreciate the author's use of language. Each story bears different themes and characterisation. The varied activities conducted by teachers help make this programme engaging for students. 

In addition to reading the stipulated literary works recommended by teachers, students also participate in the school's Annual Reading Superstar Competition where they collaborate to create videos or podcasts that capture their reflections on the texts that they have read. Selected students also attend reading-related activities and literary seminars, such as the Mother Tongue Fortnight events organised in school or other similar events held in other schools and at the language centre. 

Students will:  
•  Gain interest in reading and broaden their exposure to different text types   
•  Develop critical thinking skills as they reflect on their reading of various works  
•  Be more confident and effective communicators as they create videos/podcasts to present their reflections  
•  Appreciate and understand the author's craft and creativity in conveying meaning so that they can sharpen their own skills in reading and writing  

## Secondary One to Three

#### Mother Tongue Fortnight Programme

Students are immersed in various cultural and literary activities during the Mother Tongue Fortnight. 

The activities in this programme are varied and cater to students of different levels. The activities also involve mass participation to allow every student to enjoy, appreciate and understand the language and culture.

Students will:  
•  Widen their knowledge and appreciation of their MTL and culture through various hands on activities  
•  Extend their learning and understanding of their MTL beyond the classroom
