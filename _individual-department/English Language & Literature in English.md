<p><strong>Too often we teach our students what to think, not how to think.</strong> 
<br>The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)</p>
<p>The English Language and Literature Department's focus is to nurture our
students’ critical thinking and effective communication skills. We want
our students to develop meta-cognitively, knowing why they do what they
do. This will in turn translate into students becoming more effective readers,
viewers, writers and speakers of the language.</p>
<p>Literature is also integral in developing students to be (i) critical
readers who can appreciate the nuances of language and the author's intent
when using language for impact, (ii) empathetic and global thinkers who
can consider multiple perspectives and are sensitive to other's experiences,
(iii) creative meaning makers who can confidently form their own informed
interpretations, and (iv) convincing communicators who can effectively
articulate their views.</p>
<p>In developing these skills, our mission is for Temasekians to become more
self-directed in their learning and application. This way, they will become
confident, purposeful and responsible users of the language.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Secondary One to Five</h2>
<h4>The Reading Programme</h4>
<p>Our Reading Programme has been re-conceptualised with the aim to not only
cultivate a good reading culture among Temasekians, but also to inculcate
habits of thinking that will develop Temasekians into critical thinkers.
Students are challenged to assess biasness, consider multiple perspectives
and draw connections to larger issues (just to name a few thinking frames)
when they engage with a text. The selection of multimodal texts that our
students will read and discuss has also been specially curated by our team
of teachers. They explore current and relevant issues that will encourage
students to broaden their horizons and question their pre-existing assumptions.</p>
<p>Students will:</p>
<p>•&nbsp; Appreciate reading and viewing by looking at the authors’ craft
in conveying meaning in creative ways, by manipulating language or by employing
the clever art of storytelling or argumentation</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;Develop a sense of curiosity that will spark more self-directed
pursuits as they engage in a variety of texts</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;Become better writers, orators and hence more effective communicators</p>
<h2>Lower Secondary</h2>
<h4>Readers' Theatre/Production of a Trailer</h4>
<p>This performative learning experience develops students’ ability to articulate
with intent and meaning, representing what they read and hear effectively
as they convey the appropriate emotions and characterisation of the individuals
in a text. After all, every story told well paints a million images in
the listeners’ and viewers’ minds.</p>
<p>Students will:</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;Become more effective meaning makers who can communicate
with clarity</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;Appreciate and analyse the nuances of language: how meaning
and emotions can be conveyed with subtlety, or with certainty</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;Take into consideration Purpose, Audience, Context and Culture,
a crucial life skill that is relevant for effective communication in real
life contexts, and across all disciplines</p>
<h2>Secondary One to Three</h2>
<h4>Public Speaking</h4>
<p>Selected students who have the talent and passion for public speaking
will be identified by their teachers to be trained and to provided with
platforms to develop their craft as orators. Seen as our way of stretching
students with talent, these opportunities see students developing skills
beyond the classroom curriculum.</p>
<p>Students will:</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;Develop their thinking as they begin to venture into the
conceptual thinking process behind the writing and delivery of their own
speeches</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;Become responsible, critical thinkers who seek feedback from
others in order to improve their skills</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;Gain confidence as writers or speakers</p>
<h2>Secondary One to Five</h2>
<h4>Literary Appreciation Programmes</h4>
<p>Various literary experiences (e.g. digital theatre programme and SingLit
Station’s Book a Writer series) are organised for the students across their
four/five years in Temasek. These authentic learning opportunities will
serve to enrich and enhance their understanding of how language can be
used in an impactful and purposeful manner through different artistic forms.</p>
<p>Students will:</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;Foster greater appreciation for the literary arts</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;Learn more about the craft of writing through learning experiences
that involve engagement with practitioners in the field</p>
