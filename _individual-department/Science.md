The Science Department's focus is to develop students who continuously seek knowledge, appreciate the works of science in their daily lives and are aware of scientific developments around them. Our science curriculum seeks to help students enjoy and value science as a tool to help them explore the natural and physical world.  

"The important thing is not to stop questioning; curiosity has its own reason for existing." - Albert Einstein

  

## Lower Secondary Science

Lower Secondary Science is designed to provide students with an understanding of the natural and physical world around them and to equip them with a basic level of scientific knowledge and practices. Together with embedded values and ethics, the syllabus guides students to apply scientific knowledge and practices to make informed decisions and take responsible actions in their everyday lives.

  

## Biology

Biology is a two year O-Level subject designed to have less emphasis on factual materials, but a much greater emphasis on the understanding and applications of science. One important aspect of learning Biology is the appreciation of life, understanding how living organisms interact with the environment as well as how we can learn to take care of our own health. The programme also exposes students to bioethical considerations in the real world. From organ trading to genetic engineering, students will engage in discussions about the value of life from various viewpoints of society. Through this, students will learn to appreciate the importance of values and viewpoints in science investigation and articulate the ethical implications in making a decision when faced with a moral dilemma.

  

## Chemistry

Chemistry is commonly known as the essential science that helps us make sense of the world through the “works” of science. The design of the curriculum allows for greater understanding and application of scientific concepts and principles. Apart from the experimental skills and techniques required to carry out scientific investigations, live demonstrations are used to improve the level of inquiry engagement of students. Students are challenged with authentic problems, so as to apply their scientific reasoning and knowledge. In order for students to focus on their hypothesis and explanation, the demonstrations are related to the topics they are learning but not yet explained in the textbooks. With demonstrations anchored to topics learnt in the syllabus, students learn to apply familiar concepts to multiple situations.

  

## Physics

The study of Physics aims to provide students with a coherent understanding of energy, matter and their inter-relationships. Lessons feature a variety of learning experiences designed to promote acquisition of scientific knowledge and understanding, and to develop values and attitudes relevant to science. Students' interests are piqued through live demonstrations as they try to understand the dichotomy between what we can and cannot directly see. This constitutes two contrasting views which we call macroscopic and microscopic. Students are also challenged to apply their investigative and problem-solving skills in performing authentic tasks.

  

## Coding

The Temasek school experience aims to equip students with the knowledge, skills and attributes which would enable them to thrive in an increasingly complex world. Students are thus encouraged to venture beyond the academic pursuits and explore areas of interests which would develop important life skills such as problem solving and teamwork. Coding is a school-wide programme for all lower secondary students at Temasek Secondary School which aims to develop computational thinking competencies. Through the two year programme, students will acquire basic programming skills and coding concepts and apply them creatively in real life contexts through the creation of prototypes and use of microcontrollers.
