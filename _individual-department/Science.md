<p>The Science Department's focus is to develop students who continuously
seek knowledge, appreciate the works of science in their daily lives and
are aware of scientific developments around them. Our science curriculum
seeks to help students enjoy and value science as a tool to help them explore
the natural and physical world.</p>
<p>"The important thing is not to stop questioning; curiosity has its own
reason for existing." - Albert Einstein</p>
<h2>Lower Secondary Science</h2>
<p>Lower Secondary Science is designed to provide students with an understanding
of the natural and physical world around them and to equip them with a
basic level of scientific knowledge and practices. Together with embedded
values and ethics, the syllabus guides students to apply scientific knowledge
and practices to make informed decisions and take responsible actions in
their everyday lives.</p>
<h2>Biology</h2>
<p>Biology is a two year O-Level subject designed to have less emphasis on
factual materials, but a much greater emphasis on the understanding and
applications of science. One important aspect of learning Biology is the
appreciation of life, understanding how living organisms interact with
the environment as well as how we can learn to take care of our own health.
The programme also exposes students to bioethical considerations in the
real world. From organ trading to genetic engineering, students will engage
in discussions about the value of life from various viewpoints of society.
Through this, students will learn to appreciate the importance of values
and viewpoints in science investigation and articulate the ethical implications
in making a decision when faced with a moral dilemma.</p>
<h2>Chemistry</h2>
<p>Chemistry is commonly known as the essential science that helps us make
sense of the world through the “works” of science. The design of the curriculum
allows for greater understanding and application of scientific concepts
and principles. Apart from the experimental skills and techniques required
to carry out scientific investigations, live demonstrations are used to
improve the level of inquiry engagement of students. Students are challenged
with authentic problems, so as to apply their scientific reasoning and
knowledge. In order for students to focus on their hypothesis and explanation,
the demonstrations are related to the topics they are learning but not
yet explained in the textbooks. With demonstrations anchored to topics
learnt in the syllabus, students learn to apply familiar concepts to multiple
situations.</p>
<h2>Physics</h2>
<p>The study of Physics aims to provide students with a coherent understanding
of energy, matter and their inter-relationships. Lessons feature a variety
of learning experiences designed to promote acquisition of scientific knowledge
and understanding,&nbsp;and to develop values and attitudes relevant to
science. Students' interests are piqued through live demonstrations as
they try to understand the dichotomy between what we can and cannot directly
see. This constitutes two contrasting views which we call macroscopic and
microscopic. Students are also challenged to apply their investigative
and problem-solving skills in performing authentic tasks.</p>
<h2>Coding</h2>
<p>The Temasek school experience aims to equip students with the knowledge,
skills and attributes which would enable them to thrive in an increasingly
complex world. Students are thus encouraged to venture beyond the academic
pursuits and explore areas of interests which would develop important life
skills such as problem solving and teamwork. Coding is a school-wide programme
for all lower secondary students at Temasek Secondary School which aims
to develop computational thinking competencies. Through the two year programme,
students will acquire basic programming skills and coding concepts and
apply them creatively in real life contexts through the creation of prototypes
and use of microcontrollers.</p>
