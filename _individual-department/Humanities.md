<h3>DEPARTMENT PROGRAMMES</h3>
<p>The Humanities Department aims to develop students with empathy for the
human and physical world through the knowledge, skills and values acquired
from a Humanities education. Our Humanities curriculum seeks to educate
students to be informed, concerned and participative citizens.</p>
<p>The following subjects are offered by the Department: Social Studies,
History, Geography, Economics, Principles of Accounts and Elements of Business
Skills.</p>
<h2>Lower Secondary</h2>
<h4>Geographical &amp; Historical Investigations</h4>
<p>In line with the current Lower Secondary Humanities curriculum, the Geographical
and Historical Investigations provide students with opportunities to conduct
studies on their communities.</p>
<p>Issues covered in the Investigations may include local perceptions on
water as a resource or life in Singapore during colonial times. The Lower
Secondary Investigations are structured and closely guided by teachers
to help students understand the rigour expected during investigations.</p>
<p>Students will:</p>

<h4>Model United Nations (MUN)</h4>
<p>Students who show interest in current affairs and world issues are offered
opportunities to participate in various MUNs across the year.</p>
<p>MUNs that students have participated in include the Dunman High Model
ASEAN Plus Summit as well as the Singapore Model Cabinet. This is part
of the Department's Talent Development Programme which enables students

develop public speaking skills.</p>
