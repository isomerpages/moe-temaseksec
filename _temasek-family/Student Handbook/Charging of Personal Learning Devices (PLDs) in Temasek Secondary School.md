Charging PLDs in school is a privilege for Temasekians.

*   The charging station in every classroom is a shared facility for all Temasekians.
*   Temasekians should therefore remove their PLDs and all their cables
*   immediately after charging to allow the next user to charge his/her PLD.

  

Temasekians are strongly encouraged to bring their PLDs home to be charged fully before bringing back to school the next school day. In view of student well-being, Temasekians may lock their PLDs overnight in their assigned lockers from Monday to Thursday to lighten the load of their school bags. They must bring their PLDs home on Fridays or on the eve of a school holiday, public holiday or HBL day. PLDs must not be stored in the lockers over the weekend or for more than one night such that they cannot be checked immediately the next day.

  

Temasekians who lock their PLDs in their lockers overnight must check their PLDs the following day for safety reasons. PLDs must not be left unchecked for more than a day.

  

### PLD CHARGING STATION - TERMS OF USE

*   Temasekians are only allowed to charge their PLDs using the prescribed cable and charger that came with the PLD.
*   No charging of other devices, including handphones, is allowed.
*   Temasekians are responsible for their own device, charger and cable.
*   PLDs must not be left unattended at all times.
*   Temasekians must NOT place the PLDs for charging in an unsafe manner that may pose a hazard to others. Tidy the cable and make sure that there is no dangling cable.
*   Temasekians are NOT to use their PLDs while charging is in progress at the charging station.
