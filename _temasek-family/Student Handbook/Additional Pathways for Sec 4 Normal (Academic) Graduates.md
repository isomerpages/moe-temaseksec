Students who meet the criteria for progression to Secondary 5N (i.e. EL-Maths\-Best 3 Subjects &lt; 19) based on their GCE&nbsp;N&nbsp;Level examination will be given two additional options, on top of having the choice of enrolling in Higher&nbsp;Nitec&nbsp;courses in the ITE.

#### 1\. POLYTECHNIC FOUNDATION PROGRAMME (PFP)


The PFP is a one-year programme that offers a practice-oriented curriculum taught by Polytechnic lecturers to better prepare Polytechnic-bound N(A) students for entry into relevant Polytechnic Diploma courses. Instead of going through Secondary 5, PFP students are given provisional places in diploma&nbsp;programmes,&nbsp;subjected&nbsp;to them passing all modules in the one-year PFP. Students will then be admitted to the first year of their pre-selected polytechnic courses.  

Secondary 4&nbsp;N(A)&nbsp;students who obtain an&nbsp;ELMAB3 aggregate score&nbsp;not exceeding 12 points&nbsp;(excluding CCA bonus points) at the GCE&nbsp;N Level&nbsp;examination will be eligible to apply for the PFP, provided the students also meet the criteria of respective PFP courses. To apply for most PFP courses, students need to obtain&nbsp;at least&nbsp;EL ≤ 3 points and MA ≤ 3 points.

The PFP is also available to N(A) students who have sat for GCE O&nbsp;level&nbsp;subjects but did not sit for the same subjects at the GCE&nbsp;N level. Such students are allowed to use their school-based&nbsp;O level&nbsp;Preliminary Examination results to compute their eligibility.

Students are not allowed to repeat their PFP. Students who drop out from or fail the PFP can enroll in ITE’s Higher&nbsp;Nitec&nbsp;programmes. Students who wish to pursue their O&nbsp;level&nbsp;examinations may approach their secondary schools to be considered for re-admission or register as&nbsp;O level&nbsp;private candidates.

#### 2\. DIRECT-ENTRY-SCHEME-TO-POLYTECHNIC (DES-TO-POLY) PROGRAMME


The DES-to-Poly Programme builds on the ITE Direct-Entry-Scheme (DES) which was introduced in 2008. The DES is a pathway for N(A) students who do well in their&nbsp;N Levels&nbsp;to benefit from hands-on and experiential learning at the ITE by enrolling in a Higher&nbsp;Nitec&nbsp;programme, including a 10-week preparatory course, immediately after Secondary 4. They are subsequently assured of either a first or second-year place in a related Polytechnic course, provided they achieve the qualifying GPA scores in their Higher&nbsp;Nitec&nbsp;programme.  

Students who obtained an&nbsp;ELMAB3 aggregate score of 19 points or better&nbsp;(excluding CCA bonus points) at the GCE&nbsp;N Level&nbsp;examination will be eligible to apply to the DES-to-Poly Programme, provided they also obtained the following:

1.  EL ≤ 4 and MA ≤ 4 to be eligible to apply for&nbsp;Applied Sciences, Engineering and Info-Communications Technology&nbsp;Higher&nbsp;Nitec&nbsp;DES&nbsp;programmes
2.  EL ≤ 3 and MA ≤ 4 to be eligible to apply for&nbsp;Business and Services&nbsp;Higher&nbsp;Nitec&nbsp;DES&nbsp;programmes
