The school reserves the right to confiscate students’ mobile phones as a disciplinary measure if they contravene the school’s mobile phone regulations or for the purpose of investigation.

When a mobile phone is to be confiscated, the school will notify the parent/guardian.

 The school mobile phone regulations are stated below:

*   Mobile phones are to be kept in the lockers from the start of 1st period to the end of last period.  
    
*   Mobile phones are to be switched off while in school or during any school programme and they are to be kept out of sight at all times.
*   Mobile phones are only allowed to be used in the canteen/foyer/study area outside AVT during the following times:

*   after the official end of each curriculum day
*   before the start of an afternoon school programme
*   on non-curriculum days (e.g. school holidays; Saturdays)

*   Mobile phones are not allowed to be used for entertainment or recreational reasons in school e.g. watching videos, playing games, listening to music, using social media etc during curriculum time.  
    
*   If mobile phones need to be used for official/educational reasons, specific instructions will be given by the teacher/s to switch on the device for the activity and to switch off the device at the end.

  

The device confiscated for contravening the school mobile phone regulations will be kept by the staff in the general office in a safe and secure location. The collection procedures for student or parent/guardian are as follows:

**For 3rd Offence**

*   Student to collect the SIM card at the General Office only between 5.00 to 5.30pm on the day of confiscation.
