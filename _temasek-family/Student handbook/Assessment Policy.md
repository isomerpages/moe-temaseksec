## ASSESSMENT POLICY


Weighted Assessments (WA) help&nbsp;students ascertain their&nbsp;progress and understanding&nbsp;of what has been taught for each subject. They are also integral to helping the school assess a student’s academic ability especially for promotional purposes.

In order for&nbsp;assessments to be a true reflection of a student’s academic performance, a student should&nbsp;not discuss&nbsp;WA&nbsp;questions with&nbsp;his/her&nbsp;friends. A student should understand the&nbsp;value of upholding the integrity&nbsp;of a paper, not allowing others and&nbsp;himself/herself&nbsp;to be advantaged or disadvantaged.

Students&nbsp;should also&nbsp;recognise&nbsp;that&nbsp;every piece of work counts&nbsp;towards their learning&nbsp;as&nbsp;they work towards preparing for any&nbsp;WA.

### SEMESTRAL&nbsp;ASSESSMENT (SA)


Semestral&nbsp;Examinations (SA) are conducted at&nbsp;mid-year&nbsp;(for Sec 2 and&nbsp;4/5 only)&nbsp;and end of the year to evaluate students’ mastery of content and skills as well as for promotional purposes. All dates for examinations are indicated in the students’ handbook given out at the start of the year.

  

### ABSENCE FROM WEIGHTED ASSESSMENTS (TESTS)


1.  Any student who is absent from any paper should produce a MEDICAL CERTIFICATE with the doctor certifying that the student is unfit to take the examination. This should be submitted to his/her Form Teacher as soon as the student returns to school.
2.  Only ORIGINAL MEDICAL CERTIFICATES from doctors registered with the Singapore Medical Council will be accepted.
3.  Upon&nbsp;return to school, it is the student’s responsibility to&nbsp;contact his/her&nbsp;respective teacher for the test(s) missed:

*   Students&nbsp;will be required to sit for the test within 5 school days from the day the test was administered.
*   Should&nbsp;the student be away on prolonged medical leave for 5 days or more, he/she should notify the Form Teacher of the duration. The student will be exempted from the test. It will be indicated in the Progress Report as VR (Absent with Valid Reason) for the&nbsp;particular test&nbsp;component. However, students will sit for the missed papers as practice papers to ascertain their performance. No marks will be awarded for that test component.
*   When&nbsp;a VR status is given for a missed test component, the marks will not be included in the total calculation of the overall WA marks.
*   The&nbsp;overall WA performance is based on the remaining tests taken and marks will be pro-rated accordingly.

5.  In&nbsp;the event&nbsp;a&nbsp;student’s absence is not due to medical reasons, parents must write a letter addressed to the Principal and pass it to their Form Teacher. The letter should clearly state the duration and reasons for your child’s absence.
6.  The Principal will attend to each letter on a case-by-case&nbsp;basis.&nbsp;Approval is not a&nbsp;given.
7.  Zero&nbsp;marks will be given to those who have not obtained Principal’s approval for their&nbsp;absence&nbsp;or do not provide a MEDICAL CERTIFICATE for their absence.
