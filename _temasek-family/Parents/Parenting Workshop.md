Dear parents,

  

Since 2021, our CCE team has been working in partnership with Touch Cyber-wellness to organise a series of parenting workshops focused on providing practical strategies to support your child’s mental health and cyber-wellness. These workshops offer you the opportunity to hear from our Peer Support Leaders (PSLs), who share their personal perspectives as youth who are also grappling with some of these issues. These free workshops for parents have been very well-received. 

This year, we plan to further enhance our effort by providing opportunities for you to engage with our School Leaders, Year Heads and School Counsellors who will offer insights on these important topics. We will continue with our **hands-on technical session on Parental Control Apps**, where you will be guided on how to manage your child’s device usage. We believe these workshops will be helpful for many parents who have expressed concern about your children’s device usage.
